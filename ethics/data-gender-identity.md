Collecting demographics data is important in helping open projects understand the impact of interventions we make to be a more inclusive, and welcoming project.
That said, it's extremely important to always, always, always ensure you know why you are asking for sensitive data and avoid risk to underrepresented groups and idnviduals. Here are some prompts.

Always include your organization's privacy policy.

* If you are asking for **gender identity**, how will you use that data? If you don't know a use case, don't ask.
* If you are asking whether someone is **transgender** how do you intend to benefit that demographic with your findings?  If you dont know, don't ask.
* If you are asking gender identity, you cannot query people under 19.  Add checkbox to ensure people are over 19.
* If you are collecting personally identifying information like name, email, Github ID ,AND gender identity information, do you have in place:
  * Legal approval and Institutional Review Board approval
  * Standards for handling this data, that will ensure results are anonymized beyond any recognition.

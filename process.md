# Process of creating a D&I report

1. **Planning and Preparation Phase**
    - a. Goal setting - Why do we want a D&I report? What questions do we have?
    - b. Rally support: Stakeholder onboarding.
    - c. Decide which metrics can best answer the questions your community has look at CHAOSS resources.
    - d. Prepare data collection strategy based on chosen metrics.
    - e. Plan dissemination strategy - What should the D&I report look like? Do we need a written report, a webinar, a conference presentation, or a blog post? When should it be announced? At what conferences can we discuss the results? What decisions are we informing and what format do the decision makers need the results in?
    - f. Feedback from the community before we start data collection

## Recognition of Good Work

Goal: Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.

Name | Question
--- | ---
Contribution Type | Does recognition skew to a speciifc type of contribution?  How are we missing altogether(see Contribution for list of types identified to track)
Contribution Volume | Do we have a bias towards small contributions or multiple contributions?
Recognition Type |  TBD (i.e. thank you in PR comments, blog post, badges  etc)
Recognition Value | Do different demographics value different types of recognition?  (qualitative?)

# Inclusive Experience at Event 

Question: To what extent does an event organizing team commit to an inclusive experience at an event?

## Description

If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did the tree really fall?

Similarly, we need to judge the inclusiveness of an event not only by the effort of the organizers but also by the response of event attendees.

Inclusiveness of an event is most impactful when attendees feel included and welcome. All efforts that organizers invest into making an event inclusive are in vain if attendees do not experience the event as inclusive and welcoming. This metric focuses on the work by event organizers and the outcomes from that work on the inclusive experiences of event attendees. 

## Objectives

This metric is designed to:
 - Enable event organizers to ensure all attendees are welcomed and included at events
 - Encourage event organizers to build inclusivity into the event to provide a sense of belonging
 - Provide methods to measure inclusion in experience at an event

## Implementation

Provide attendees with a venue to express concerns regarding inclusivity at the event
 - Ensure that anyone who voices a concern is heard
 - Ensure violations are acted upon
 - Survey attendees about perceptions of inclusivity

### Data Collection Strategies

Ask attendees and speakers:

Survey with Likert Scale [1-5] (Or Emoji Scale):
 - I feel included at the event
 - I feel uniquely valued by the event staff
 - I had chances for my voice to be heard in sessions
 - I plan to come back to this event
	
Interview attendees and speakers:
 - Have you experienced anything during the event that made you feel unwelcome or unincluded?
 - Did you observe something that could make someone else feel unwelcome and unincluded?
 - Could you provide specific examples to help event organizers mitigate this in the future?
 - What is something that organizers of this event could improve on in the future regarding inclusivity at the event?

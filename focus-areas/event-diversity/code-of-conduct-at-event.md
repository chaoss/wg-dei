# Code of Conduct at Event

Question: How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?

## Description
A code of conduct describes rules of good behavior between event participants and what avenues are available when someone violates those expected good behaviors.
An event with a code of conduct sends the signal that the organizers are willing to respond to incidences, which helps people from all backgrounds feel included and comfortable attending the event. Event participants are empowered to report incidences and proactively help mitigate situations of unwanted behavior.

## Objectives
- An event organizer wants to make sure they have effective processes in place to deal with misbehaving attendees.
- An event organizer wants to make sure that participants have a positive experience at the event.
- Event participants want to know how to report offensive behavior.
- Event participants want to know that they will be safe at an event.

## Implementation
*The usage and dissemination of health metrics may lead to privacy violations. Organizations may be exposed to risks. These risks may flow from compliance with the GDPR in the EU, with state law in the US, or with other law. There may also be contractual risks flowing from terms of service for data providers such as GitHub and GitLab. The usage of metrics must be examined for risk and potential data ethics problems. Please see [CHAOSS Data Ethics document](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/data-use-statement.md) for additional guidance.*

### Data Collection Strategies

**Observe whether a code of conduct is posted at an event:*
- As an attendee or event staff, observe whether participants will have an easy time finding a code of conduct posted at the event. Having a code of conduct prominently posted at a registration site may be useful.
- Observe that code of conduct has a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event.

**Observe event website:**
- Observe that code of conduct on the website has a clear avenue for reporting violations via email.
- Observe that code of conduct/event website provides information about possible ways to provide support victims of inappropriate behaviour, eventually links to external bodies?
- Browse the event website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be easily discoverable)

**Interview and/or survey participants to understand more about why the event code of conduct did or did not meet their expectations:**
- What can this event do to improve the code of conduct at this event?
- What are some examples of how this event met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?
- Are participants required to accept the code of conduct before completing registration?

**Survey participants about the code of conduct:**
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How well did the event meet your code of conduct expectations.
  * On registration, and during the event were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate at this event? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]

# Speaker Demographics

Question: How well does the speaker lineup for the event represent a diverse set of demographics and can be improved in the future?


## Description

Speakers with diverse backgrounds who represent a variety of [demographics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data) help an event provide different viewpoints and broader perspectives. Events with diverse speakers allow people from a variety of different backgrounds to feel more included in an event when they see people with similar demographics in important positions within the community. 


## Objectives

- Speakers are from diverse [backgrounds](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data).
- Speakers are diverse when grouped by keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
- Repeat speakers are from diverse backgrounds (retention). 


## Implementation

### Filters

- [demographics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data): Some subjective questions should be analyzed in light of the responder’s demographics. Everyone has a different perspective. Investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether some demographics feel less included than the average.
- Keynotes, sessions, and tracks

  * Compare proposals submitted by speakers from diverse backgrounds to accepted proposals

# Event Accessibility

Question: To what extent does your event accommodate those with various accessibility needs?

## Description

Accessibility at in-person and virtual events is of the utmost importance. Not only do organizers want an event to be as inclusive as possible, in many locations, it is the event organizer’s legal responsibility to address and to provide equal access. 

## Objectives

This metric aims to help event organizers present to event attendees and to track, over time, the accessibility of an event, by documenting and cataloging accessibility measures taken by the organizing team. Ultimately, this aims to empower event attendees with specific accessibility needs to make the right decision for them on whether the event is inclusive to their needs.

## Implementation

*The usage and dissemination of health metrics may lead to privacy violations. Organizations may be exposed to risks. These risks may flow from compliance with the GDPR in the EU, with state law in the US, or with other law. There may also be contractual risks flowing from terms of service for data providers such as GitHub and GitLab. The usage of metrics must be examined for risk and potential data ethics problems. Please see [CHAOSS Data Ethics document](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/data-use-statement.md) for additional guidance.*

Depending on the size of the event as well as the financial constraints and implementations may include:

- Accessibility audit of the event website (e.g. colorblind-friendly contrasts, screen-reader support, etc.)
- Remote access via live stream
- Captioning in live stream and in-person settings 
- Sign language interpreters
- Sighted guides at the event
- Wheelchair access
- Quiet room for meditation, prayer, or rest
- Ensure your registration system allows for dietary needs (multiple if possible)
- Provide accessible washrooms
- Provide amenities / feminine hygiene products in washrooms
- Website and on-site event signage that is color-blind friendly 
- Providing a speaker guide with relevant accessibility guidance (for example, ensuring their slides are color-blind friendly)
- Providing agendas and other important conference documents in Braille language
- Asking about any accessibility needs prior to the event during conference registration
- Providing information on the website with regard to the number of stairs or steps to and from the main entrance, conference rooms, and restrooms
- Access to the slides and presentations before, during, and after the conference is over
- Low-bandwidth platform considerations
- Gender-neutral restrooms
- Room design (photo rows, strollers)
- [Family Friendliness](https://chaoss.community/metric-family-friendliness/)
- Using visual cues (e.g. floor stickers, spacers, etc.) to facilitate social distancing in densely populated places or queues, e.g. ticketing, food, etc.

Event organizers should have a comprehensive list of the initiatives they’ve implemented, and should make that list available on their website for attendees and speakers.

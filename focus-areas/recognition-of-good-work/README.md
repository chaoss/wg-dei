## Recognition of Good Work

Goal: Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.

Name  |  Question
--- | ---
[Contribution Type](contribution-type.md)  |  Does recognition skew to a particular kind of contribution? How are we missing altogether (see Contribution for a list of types identified to track)
[Contribution Volume](contribution-volume.md) | Do we have a bias towards small contributions or multiple contributions?
[Recognition Type](recognition-type.md) | TBD (i.e. thank you in PR comments, blog post, badges, etc.)
[Recognition Value](recognition-value.md) | Do different demographics value different types of recognition?  (qualitative?)


### Comments/Discussion

1. Can we add ways of recognition.
2. How we recognize differnt categories of PR's.

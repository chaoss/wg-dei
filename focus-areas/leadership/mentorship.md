# Leadership - Mentorship


Question: How effective are our mentorship programs at supporting diversity and inclusion in our project?


## Description

Mentorship programs are a vital component in growing and sustaining a community by inviting newcomers to join a community and helping existing members grow within a community, thereby ensuring the health of the overall community. Through mentorship programs, we can invite diverse contributors and create inclusive environments for contributors to grow and ideally give back to the community.


## Objectives

- Increase the number and diversity of new contributors
- Increase the level of contributions from each contributor, from a quantitative or qualitative perspective
- Increase the number of and diversity of contributors, encouraging them to grow into new roles with increasing responsibility within a community, e.g. from newcomers to contributing more extensively and becoming core reviewers, and ultimately, growing into maintainer roles within a community, or those who are more seasoned and moving into roles within new communities
- Increase the number of advocates/evangelists for a project
- Increase the number of paid mentors and mentees
- Cultivate a culture of inclusivity through identifying and supporting mentors and mentees


## Strategies

- Ask Foundation members about existing formal or informal mentorship programs
- Look for people informally mentoring new contributors (e.g., those reviewing newcomers in the code review process)
- Survey mentors and mentees
- Interview mentors and mentees
- Observe contributions that mentees make during and after the mentorship program
- Observe trajectory of mentees within project during and after mentorship program
- Collect demographic information from mentors and mentees

- Number of contributions from mentees
- Mentors experience (rounds or years mentored)
- Geographic distribution of mentees
- Retention rate of mentees vs the usual retention rate in the community

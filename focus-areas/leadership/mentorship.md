# Leadership - Mentorship

## Question

**Question:** How effective are our mentorship programs at supporting diversity and inclusion in our project?


## 1. Description

Mentorship programs are a vital component in growing and sustaining a community by inviting newcomers to join a community and helping existing members grow within a community, thereby ensuring the health of the overall community. Through mentorship programs, we can invite diverse contributors and create inclusive environments for contributors to grow and ideally give back to the community.


## 2. Sample Objectives

- Increase the number and diversity of new contributors
- Increase the level of contributions from each contributor, from a quantitative or qualitative perspective
- Increase the number of and diversity of contributors, encouraging them to grow into new roles with increasing responsibility within a community, e.g. from newcomers to contributing more extensively and becoming core reviewers, and ultimately, growing into maintainer roles within a community, or those who are more seasoned and moving into roles within new communities
- Increase the number of advocates/evangelists for a project
- Increase the number of paid mentors and mentees
- Cultivate a culture of inclusivity through identifying and supporting mentors and mentees


## 3. Sample Strategies

- Ask Foundation members about existing formal or informal mentorship programs
- Look for people informally mentoring new contributors (e.g., those reviewing newcomers in the code review process)
- Survey mentors and mentees
- Interview mentors and mentees
- Observe contributions that mentees make during and after the mentorship program
- Observe trajectory of mentees within project during and after mentorship program
- Collect demographic information from mentors and mentees


## 4. Sample Success Metrics

_Qualitative_

- Mentee became a subject matter expert
- Mentee is integrated in community
- Mentee is comfortable asking for help from anyone in the community
- Mentee grew their professional network
- Mentee has taken on responsibilities within community

- Survey Likert item (1-4): I have found the mentoring experience personally rewarding.
- Survey Likert item (1-4): I would recommend mentoring for this community.
- Survey Likert item (1-4): I would recommend mentoring for this community.
- Mentor survey feedback:
    * What training did you receive that helped your mentoring activity?
    * What community support was helpful for your mentoring activity?
    * What communication channels did you use for mentoring?
    * What are the first things you do with a new mentee?

_Quantitative_

- Number of mentees who finished a mentorship program (assumes a time/project bound mentorship program like GSoC, Outreachy, or CommunityBridge)
- Number of mentees who started mentorship
- Number of mentors in community
- Number of diverse mentees
- Number of contributions from mentees
- Mentors experience (rounds or years mentored)
- Geographic distribution of mentees
- Retention rate of mentees vs the usual retention rate in the community
- Variety of projects participating in a mentorship program (e.g., in the OpenStack Gender Report a few of them were participating)
- Variety of mentorship programs across a project ecosystem targeting different contribution levels (e.g., contribution ladder, onion layers)
- Number of official mentors in the mentorship programs
    * How many mentors repeat the position in the following years

# Focus Area: Inclusive Leadership

Leadership is central to project and community culture, and thus requires intentional design, and accountability for the inclusion of others.   

As those in leadership roles have high visibility, the diversity of this group is critically important  - as a signal to newcomers about who is welcome, and who can be successful.  

### Examples of leadership roles:

* Project Maintainers
* Contributors with repository merge access.
* OS Program Board Members.
* Official Program Roles (Mozilla Reps, Mozilla Tech Speakers).
* Those listed in project documents as contacts for issues with builds, documentation (etc).
* Those with > 5 pull requests to a project.
* *please add other descriptions*

**NOTE:** The term 'leader' doesn't always resonate, if that's the case for your project, replace with 'roles of influence'.

### Background

The principles and practices below were created and agreed upon by a cross-functional set of diverse group of Mozilla staff and volunteers who are most closely connected to the primary contribution areas SUMO, Mozilla Reps, L10N).

[Read more here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Volunteer_leadership_principles).

They have been applied to the following projects/products:

* Mozilla Open Source Support Program ([MOSS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/))
* [Mozilla Reps Program](https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2018/10/10/community-coordinator-role/)
* [Firefox Developer Tools / Debugger Program](https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/blob/aa827095d86475f816017ff35d6f9c2e83cf7b9b/docs/community-team.md)
* [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) ('File an Inclusion Bug!')
* Add your project.

## Understand

The first step is to understand the principles of inclusive leadership.

----

### 1.Community/project leadership should be setup for regular review & renewal.

* To avoid gatekeeping, periods of renewal should be set for all leadership roles. Minimally once per year.
* Terms should include opportunities for review and feedback from the communities they serve.

### 2.Leadership should be distributed

* The number of leadership roles one person can hold, should be limited.
* New leadership opportunities and pathways should be decided and consulted on by the community involved in that area.
* Criteria for the role requirements should be validated by the community involved.
* We should create clear definitions for roles and avoid the generic term “leader”.  
* Leadership responsibility should be held by groups (and not individuals where possible.

### 3. Leadership should be accountable

* Leadership roles should be clearly defined, and publicly documented.
* Leaders should agree to a standard by which they can be held accountable.
* Staff & community should know, and understand how they can  hold leaders accountable.
* Projects/communities should enforce the Community Participation Guidelines (Code of Conduct) consistently.
* All leaders should be aware that they represent the organization/project.
* All leaders should follow, and continually evolve a shared framework for decision making.
* Leadership should openly communicate periods of inactivity, or unavailability with the project, and community.

### 4. Is our Governance setup to support and protect diverse participation?

* Leaders should strive to include diverse voices and groups whenever possible.
* Projects should enforce the Code of Conduct consistently and strictly
* Leadership pathways should explicitly consider inclusion dimensions (i.e. time, language, bandwidth, cultural norms)

### 5. Leadership should be consistent

* Leadership roles are valued the same across the org/areas. (recognition, access to resources, opportunities etc. )
* All leaders should have clarity in their roles and expectations
* All leaders should have a shared foundational knowledge base & skills (i.e. Community Participation Guidelines).
* Follow a shared framework for decision making
* We should create clear definitions for roles and avoid the generic term “leader”.
* Tools should be consistent and coherent where possible.

### 6. Leadership should include Technical and  non-technical Experts

* Projects should value and recognize them equally.
* Both should have a minimum capability in the other skill set (community management skills & technical skill).

##  Example Strategies (Organized by Program Goals)
Goals  you might already have, and the 'inclusive leadership checklists' that will help ensure your goals are also inclusive.

* Increase % in contribution typically done by project maintainers (pull request review, responding to, and trying to replicate issues).

# Inclusive Leadership

Question: How well is a project and community setup for diverse leadership?


## Description

Leadership is central to a project/community's culture and how the leadership is determined requires intentional design and accountability for the inclusion of others. Note the term leadership may vary depending on the project/community. Leadership roles have high visibility and the diversity of this group is critically important to fostering an inclusive community.

## Objectives

- Enable communities to reflect on their own leadership practices. 
- Signal to newcomers that everyone is welcome, has an opportunity to take on leadership roles, and can be successful within the project. 

## Implementation

### Filters

**Examples of open source leadership (e.g., influential community roles):**

* Individuals serving as project maintainers (sometimes referred to as owners)
* Individuals with repository merge access
* Individuals who are organization members for the repository
* Individuals who have defined community roles (community representatives, community speakers)
* Individuals listed in project documents as contacts for issues with builds, documentation, or other community concerns
* Individuals serving as community event organizers 
* Individuals serving as community mentors for available mentorship programs

### Data Collection Strategies

**Step 1: Understand**

The first step is to understand the principles of inclusive leadership by asking some questions that can include:

_Review & Renewal_

* Are all leadership roles limited by time and require term renewal?
* Do the term renewals include opportunities for review and feedback from communities involved?
* Is there a graceful way to move people out of leadership roles and into emeritus or advisory roles?

_Distribution of Leaders_

* Are leaders limited in the number of leadership roles one person can hold?
* Are new leadership opportunities and pathways decided and consulted on by the community involved in that area?
* Are the criteria for the role requirements validated by the community involved?
* Does the project create clear definitions for roles?
* Does the project publicly document their definitions for roles?
* Is leadership responsibility held by groups and not individuals, where possible?

_Accountability_

* Do the projectâ€™s leaders agree to a standard by which they can be held accountable?
* Do the staff & community know and understand how they can hold leaders accountable?
* Are leaders aware that they represent the organization/project in their actions?
* Are leaders following and continually evolving a shared framework for decision making?
* Does the leadership openly communicate periods of inactivity or unavailability with the project and community?

_Diverse Participation_

* Do the project leaders strive to include diverse voices and groups whenever possible?
* Does the project enforce the Code of Conduct consistently and strictly?
* Do the leadership pathway explicitly consider inclusion dimensions (e.g., time zone, language, bandwidth, and cultural norms)?

_Roles & Consistency_

* Are the leadership roles valued similarly across the project (e.g., recognition, access to resources, and opportunities)?
* Do all leaders have clarity in their roles and expectations?
* Do all leaders have a shared foundational knowledge base & skills (e.g., Community Participation Guidelines).
* Does project leadership follow a shared framework for decision making?
* Are project roles clearly defined?
* Are the related tools consistent and coherent, where possible?

_Equal Value_

* Does the project value and recognize different types of experts equally (e.g., technical and non-technical)?

_Acknowledgement of Limitations_

* Have project leaders identified technical, financial, or other limitations out of their control that may have an adverse impact on inclusivity?
* Has leadership clearly and explicitly acknowledged these limitations publicly?
* Are leaders open to discussing and implementing suggestions that reduce the impact of these limitations?


**Step 2: Evaluate**
The second step is to evaluate your project/community according to existing goals for leadership.  

_Example Goal:_ Increase % in contribution typically done by project maintainers (pull request review, responding to, and trying to replicate issues).


**Step 3: Take Action**
The third step is to act on what you've learned. What those steps are depends on your specific project community and giving recommendations is outside the scope of this document.

# Inclusive Leadership

Question: How well is a project setup for diverse leadership?


## Description

Leadership is central to project and community culture, and thus requires intentional design, and accountability for the inclusion of others.    

**Examples of open source leadership (aka 'roles with influence' )**:

* Project maintainers
* Contributors with repository merge access.
* OS Program Board Members.
* Official Program Roles (Mozilla Reps, Mozilla Tech Speakers).
* Those listed in project documents as contacts for issues with builds, documentation (etc).
* Those with > 5 pull requests to a project.
* *please add other descriptions*

**NOTE:** The term 'leader' doesn't always resonate, if that's the case for your project, replace with 'roles of influence'.


## Objectives

As those in leadership roles have high visibility, the diversity of this group is critically important  - as a signal to newcomers about who is welcome, and who can be successful. Ensure stable and consistent leadership that is representative of a project's diversity.


## Implementation

**Understand**

The first step is to understand the principles of inclusive leadership. This is structured in 6 principles which serve as a check-list.

----

_1. Leadership should be setup for regular review & renewal._

* To avoid gatekeeping, periods of renewal should be set for all leadership roles. Minimally once per year.
* Terms should include opportunities for review and feedback from the communities they serve.

_2. Leadership should be distributed._

* The number of leadership roles one person can hold, should be limited.
* New leadership opportunities and pathways should be decided and consulted on by the community involved in that area.
* Criteria for the role requirements should be validated by the community involved.
* We should create clear definitions for roles and avoid the generic term “leader”.  
* Leadership responsibility should be held by groups (and not individuals where possible.

_3. Leadership should be accountable._

* Leadership roles should be clearly defined, and publicly documented.
* Leaders should agree to a standard by which they can be held accountable.
* Staff & community should know, and understand how they can hold leaders accountable.
* Projects/communities should enforce the Community Participation Guidelines (Code of Conduct) consistently.
* All leaders should be aware that they represent the organization/project.
* All leaders should follow, and continually evolve a shared framework for decision making.
* Leadership should openly communicate periods of inactivity, or unavailability with the project, and community.

_4. Leadership should support diverse participation, protected by governance._

* Leaders should strive to include diverse voices and groups whenever possible.
* Projects should enforce the Code of Conduct consistently and strictly.
* Leadership pathways should explicitly consider inclusion dimensions (i.e. time, language, bandwidth, cultural norms).

_5. Leadership should be consistent._

* Leadership roles are valued the same across the org/areas. (recognition, access to resources, opportunities etc.).
* All leaders should have clarity in their roles and expectations.
* All leaders should have a shared foundational knowledge base & skills (i.e. Community Participation Guidelines).
* Follow a shared framework for decision making.
* We should create clear definitions for roles and avoid the generic term “leader”.
* Tools should be consistent and coherent where possible.

_6. Leadership should include technical and non-technical experts._

* Projects should value and recognize them equally.
* Both should have a minimum capability in the other skill set (community management skills & technical skill).

**Evaluate**
The second step is to evaluate your project/community according to existing goal for leadership.  

* **Goal**: Increase % in contribution typically done by project maintainers (pull request review, responding to, and trying to replicate issues).

**Take Action**
The third step is to act on what you've learned.

**Background**

The principles and practices above were created and agreed upon by a cross-functional set of diverse group of Mozilla staff and volunteers who are most closely connected to the primary contribution areas SUMO, Mozilla Reps, L10N).

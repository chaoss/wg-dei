# Code of Conduct for Project

Question: How does the Code of Conduct for the project support diversity and inclusion?

## Description

A code of conduct signals to project members what behavior is acceptable. A code of conduct also provides enforcement mechanisms to deal with people who misbehave.


## Objectives

A code of conduct in a project provides the following: 

- Knowing that a community takes diversity and inclusion seriously.
- Evaluating a community for diverse and inclusive design, before investing any time in that project.
- Identifying whether or not their demographic is protected prior to participating in a project.
- Ensuring that project partnerships, and allies take diversity and inclusion seriously as it can impact their own reputation and community health.
- Understanding how a violation is reported and handled.
- Observing that the code of conduct is being enforced; and not just the potential for enforcement.

## Implementation

### Tools Providing the Metric

* [Mozilla Code of Conduct Assessment Tool](https://mozilla.github.io/diversity-coc-review.io/)

### Data Collection Strategies

- Identify the location of the code of conduct as it pertains to primary areas of interaction and participation in projects and events (i.e., repo root, event entrance, communication channels).
- Survey project members about their perception of how a code of conduct influences their participation and sense of safety.
- Follow-up survey for reporting, around discoverability, clarity, and relevance.

_Qualitative_

- Code of Conduct passes Mozilla’s Code of Conduct Assessment Tool
- Interview and/or survey community members to understand more about why the code of conduct does or does not meet their expectations.
  * What can the project do to improve the code of conduct?
  * What are some examples of how this community met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?

_Quantitative_

- Browse the project website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be discoverable)
- Survey participants about the code of conduct:
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How well did the project meet your code of conduct expectations?
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How clear are you on the rights and responsibilites of community members as described in the code of conduct?
  * Were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate in this project? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]

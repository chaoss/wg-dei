# Governance

**Goal:** Identify how diverse and inclusive our governance is.

This one is a bit tricker, because governance varies by project.
We might want to investigate or specifically call out governance model by [archetype](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MZOTS_OS_Archetypes_report_ext_scr.pdf).

Name | Question
--- | ---
[Foundation Staff Diversity](foundation-staff-diversity.md) | What is the diversity of foundation staff?
[Board/Council Diversity](board-council-diversity.md) | What is the diversity within our governing board or council?
[Code of Conduct for Project](code-of-conduct.md) | How does the Code of Conduct for the project support diversity and inclusion?
[Code of Conduct Enforcement](code-of-conduct-enforcement.md) | Is enforcement process running at scale?(volume, responsiveness, accuracy, fairness ...)
[Team/Module Ownership Diversity](team-module-ownership-diversity.md) | What is the diversity of other bureaucratic and administrative foundation teams, e.g. working groups, committees, or ambassador groups?
Path to Influence | What opportunities are there to move into governance?

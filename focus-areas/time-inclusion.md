# Time Inclusion for Virtual Events

Question: How can organizers of virtual events be mindful of attendees and speakers in other time zones?

## Description

Global accessibility is vital due to the role it brings in choosing when an event should take place. Time Inclusion for Virtual Events ensures support for participation from a global community during an event. Through this metric, we are able to be more inclusive to attendees and speakers in all regions of the world. 

## Objectives
 Global accessibility should be understood when creating a virtual event in order to allow attendees and speakers in all regions to benefit from the event. The goal of this metric is to help organizers of virtual events develop a reasonable method to ensure those in different time zones feel included.

## Implementation

Examples of Global Inclusion which can be implemented include:
- Having the speaker do a pre-recording where the speaker is able to answer questions live in the chat
- Doing a presentation within a certain time block for certain time zones
- Preparing and sending a recording to be live within an hour
- Network bandwidth options by platform for both live participation and video streaming at a later date

### Data Collection Strategies

Survey attendees and speakers with Likert Scale [1-5] (Or Emoji Scale):
- The event keeps time zone differences in mind
- The event caters to my needs related to differences in time
- The event provides adequate recordings of the talks I care about
- I was provided with adequate low-bandwidth options at the event

Survey attendees and speakers with Likert Scale [1-5] (Or Emoji Scale):
- The time block selected for my presentation at the event is fair to me
- I have, or will receive, a recording of my presentation for later viewing

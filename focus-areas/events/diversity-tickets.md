# Event Diversity - Diversity Access Tickets


## Question

**Question:** How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?


## 1. Description

Inviting diverse groups of people may be made explicit by offering specific tickets for them. These tickets may be discounted to add further incentive for members of the invited groups to attend. A popular example are reduced tickets for students.

Diversity access tickets can enable community members to attend events and encourage new members to join. Especially unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise economically disadvantaged people may otherwise be excluded from attending an event. Furthermore, diversity access tickets can encourage additional contributions and ongoing contributions.


## 2. Objectives

- Demonstrate effectiveness of increasing diversity at events.
- Enable attendees to attend who could not without a discount due to their economic situation.
- Encourage members from underrepresented groups to attend.
- Track effectiveness of outreach efforts.


## 3. Strategies

- Observe website for availability and pricing of diversity access tickets.
- Interview organizers to understand where and how the diversity access tickets were allocated (some organizers offer tickets directly to individuals or local groups focused on underrepresented segments, which cannot always be found by looking at the website).
- Survey participants about perception of diversity access tickets.
- Track attendance numbers based on diversity access tickets.


## 4. Success Metrics

_Qualitative_

- Interview organizers:
  * How were the diversity access tickets allocated?

_Quantitative_

- Observe website for availability and pricing of diversity access tickets.
  * How many (different) diversity access tickets are available?
  * What are the criteria for qualifying for a diversity access ticket?
  * What is the price difference between regular and diversity access tickets?
  * Are regular attendees encouraged to sponsor diversity access tickets?
  * Are sponsors of diversity access tickets named?
  * Are numbers from previous conferences displayed on website about how many diversity access tickets were used?
- Interview organizers:
  * How many (different) diversity access tickets are available?
  * What are the criteria for qualifying for a diversity access ticket?
  * How many attendees used diversity access tickets?
  * Where did you advertise diversity access tickets?
  * If any, who sponsored diversity access tickets?
- Survey participants about perception of diversity access tickets.

Usually, it's a good practice to design a Likert scale with odd numbers, so that participants can give neutral anser or option to opt-out.

  * Likert scale [1-4] item: The availability of discounted student [replace with whatever group was invited] tickets was effective in increasing participation of students [or other group].
  * True/False item: I was aware that [this conference] provided diversity access tickets.
  * True/False/Don't Know item: I qualified for a diversity access ticket.
  * True/False item: A diversity access ticket enabled me to attend [this conference].

- Track attendance numbers based on diversity access tickets.
  * Count use of different discount codes to track outreach effectiveness and which groups make use of the diversity access tickets. Requires conference registration system that tracks use of discount codes.
  * Count at each event, how many diversity access tickets were sold or given out and compare this to how many participants with those tickets sign-in at the event.

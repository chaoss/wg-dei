# Event Diversity - Family Friendliness

## Question

**Question:** How does enabling families to attend together support diversity and inclusion of the event?


## 1. Description

Family friendliness at events can lower the barrier of entry for some attendees by allowing them to bring their family. This could include childcare, activities for children, or tracks at the event targeted at youths and families.


## 2. Objectives

- An open source project wants to know whether an event is inclusive for attendees with families.
- An event organizer wants to know whether inviting people who are caregivers know about the availability of these family-oriented activities.
- A parent, guardian, or caregiver with children under the age of 18, want to know if they can bring their children.
- A parent, guardian, or caregiver, with children under the age of 18, with no option, but to bring their children, evaluate their ability to attend as a family.

# Attendee Demographics

Question: How diverse and inclusive are the attendees of an event?


## Description

Attendee [demographics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data) help indicate the potential for different viewpoints and broader perspectives at an event. 


## Objectives

- Determine if attendees are from diverse backgrounds. 
- Determine if the diversity is shared across different event spaces like sessions and tracks. 
- Help retain attendees from diverse backgrounds for future events. 


## Implementation

### Filters

- [Demographics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data) can be considered along such criteria as dis/ability, gender-identity, gender pronounds, and race/ethnicity. 
- Demographics can be considered with respect to the overall conference attendee demographics as well diversity within sessions and tracks.


### Data Collection Strategies 

- Survey speakers and general attendees during registration or following an event to learn about self-reported [demographic](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data) information. 

- Use an opt-in survey for speakers and general attendess as to what extent the event met their diversity, equity, and inclusion expectations. Sample questions include: 
  * Likert scale [1-x] item (ask all attendees): How well did the event meet your diversity, equity, and inclusion expectations?
  * Likert scale [1-x] item (ask all attendees): How was your diversity, equity, and inclusion experience at this event?

- Interview attendees to understand more about why the event did or did not meet their diversity, equity, and inclusion expectations.
  * Interview question: What can this event do to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion at this event?
  * Interview question: What are some examples of how this event met, exceeded, or fell short of your diversity, equity, and inclusion expectations?

- Quantify the demographics of attendees.
  * Use opt-in registration data for attendee demographics (if available).
  * Use an opt-in survey to gather attendee demographics. (For example, using the [Open Demographics questions](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/))

# Psychological Safety

**Question**: To what extent do community members feel safe within a community, including adding contributions, influencing change, bringing their authentic selves, and generally participating in the project?

## Overview
Psychological safety measures the extent to which community members feel secure to participate authentically without fear of negative repercussions. This includes the freedom to ask questions, propose ideas, contribute skills, and provide feedback within an open source project. Communities with high psychological safety enable members to fully engage, fostering an environment of trust and mutual respect. Such environments are critical for community health, as they encourage diverse participation and retention of contributors from varied backgrounds, strengthening the project's resilience and adaptability.

A psychologically safe environment helps address Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) issues by supporting contributors in feeling included, valued, and respected. This metric sheds light on the presence of inclusive practices, effective conflict resolution mechanisms, and leadership's transparencyâ€”all of which contribute to sustaining a welcoming and innovative community.

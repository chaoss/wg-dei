# Project Demographics

Question: What are the demographics within a project? 

## Overview
The Project Demographics metric analyzes the diversity and representation within a project community. It gathers information on participants' backgrounds, including factors like gender, identity, age, first language, and dis/ability status using references like the Open Demographics Initiative. Measuring project demographics helps assess the potential for varied viewpoints and perspectives, which can lead to a richer and more innovative project environment. Therefore, analyzing diversity across groups (board members, maintainers, organizers, contributors, and community members) helps to identify areas of improvement,  such as language translation tools, special care or mentorship programs for underrepresented groups.

### Data Collection Strategies
- Use a survey to gather project demographics. (For example, using the Open Demographics questions)
- Survey all community members via project communication channels
- Survey new community members as identified through such ways as attending newcomer office hours, recent introductions, and first time issues and merge requests. 
- Survey project maintainers.
- Survey that is activated by certain types of contributions (i.e., commits, issues, merge requests).

# Project Demographics
### This metric is a release candidate. To comment on this metric please see Issue [#[402]](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/issues/402). Following a comment period, this metric will be included in the next regular release.

Question: What are the demographics within a project? 

## Description
Project demographics help indicate the potential for different viewpoints and broader perspectives and representation in the context of a project community. Because everyone has a different perspective, investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether people from various demographics feel more or less included than the average. 

## Objectives
- Determine the [diversity] (https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) of project members. This can include gender identity, age, first language, and dis/ability.
- Help retain community members from diverse backgrounds within the project. 
- Determine if community members are diverse when grouped by [board membership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/governance/board-council-diversity.md), maintainers, conference organizers, and contributors.
- Determine if new community members are from diverse backgrounds.
- Share non-sensitive community demographic information with others.
- Create a statement of privacy management of demographic information.
- Discover less-visible stories with regard to intersectionality of the demographic data.
- Identify potential areas of improvement for inclusivity based on demographic data.

- Survey all community members via project communication channels
- Survey new community members as identified through such ways as attending newcomer office hours, recent introductions, and first time issues and merge requests. 
- Survey project maintainers.
- Survey that is activated by certain types of contributions (i.e., commits, issues, merge requests).

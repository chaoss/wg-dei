# Chat Platform Inclusivity

**Question: How do you review Chat Platform inclusivity for your community?**


## Overview
Chat Platform Inclusivity measures the inclusivity of chat platforms used in open source communities for real-time communication, including shared chat rooms, video conferences, and other synchronous interactions. Chat Platforms support a healthy project by enabling cross-team collaboration in different skill areas, helping peer collaborators find and interact faster, increasing project transparency, allowing team members to identify potential problems before they occur, and saving time by cutting across organizational hierarchies. Persistent Chat Platforms also become a reference for newcomers to familiarize themselves with project history, practice, and culture.. 
A well-moderated chat platform fosters transparent communication, accelerates innovative problem-solving, and creates a welcoming environment for all contributors, leading to project success, sustaining contributors and increased participation. Chat platforms should support diverse and equitable participation, also ensure that contributors from all backgrounds feel valued and can engage freely

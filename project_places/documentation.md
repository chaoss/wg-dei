#Documentation

## Description

Documentation is codified knowledge. Documentation can be on the processes and practices of the community, thus empowering participants to contribute with certainty for how and why things are happening. Documentation can be on the artifacts produced by the community and as such empower participants to know where to contribute and what kind of contributions further the goals of the community.

### Sample Objectives
These are the currently identified objectives, they are not definitive and we invite feedback at all times on how to improve this.

* **Accessibility Screen Reader** Documentation is accessible according to x standard for screen readers (which tool to use?)
* **Awareness** Documentation is findable
**Clarity** Documentation is easy to follow and structured intuitively
* **Relevance** Documentation is regularly updated
**Relevance** Environment builds are up to date
* **Non-Technical Confidence** Documentation limits use of unnecessary technical jargon
* **Inclusive Language** Documentation does not include non-inclusive language (this could be ‘brogrammer’ language, or exclusionary/derogatory language.

## Sample Strategies:
* A person goes through the documentation and checks off criteria listed below.
* Gather feedback from new community members using below survey questions.
* Include a quick survey (“was this documentation inclusive to you?”) at the bottom of every page.


## Sample Metrics:
### Qualitative
* Is the documentation screen reader friendly?
* TODO: link to a tool that evaluates this.
* TODO: provide an interpretation guide for the output of the tool.
* TODO: what result will indicate good diversity and inclusion?
* TODO: write specific questions that can be asked of the newcomer
* TODO: provide an analysis method for the questions
* TODO: decide what kind of answers signal good diversity and inclusion

### Quantitative
* Quick bottom-page survey
* TODO: add specific questions
* TODO: ways to analyze them.

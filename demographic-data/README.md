# Category: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

## Definitions
Some of the language we use, and what we mean.

* **Diversity**: How different are the people present?
* **Equity**: How equal are the opportunities for everyone present?
* **Inclusion**: How well do we enable these different people to work together?
* **Retention**: How long do different people stay engaged?
* **Attraction**: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?

*Example 1:* Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they don’t have to work together or stay there until tomorrow. AND just because someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience is great.

*Example 2:* Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we want to measure their degree of visibility/outness? (e.g., disability, socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)

*Example 3:* There may be women within a community that is less inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through” and participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily reflect the level of inclusion within a community.

## Dimensions of Demographics
NOTE: that *how* we might ask these questions, and what potential answers might be are currently out of scope.

*NOTE:* that regional appropriateness of demographics is also currently out of scope, and will be its own task.

*NOTE:* that the legal, privacy and ethical issues related to asking for, storing and visualizing data is currently out of scope, and will be its own task.

*NOTE:* The [Open Demographics Initiative](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/index.html) defined standard ways to ask for demographic information. CHAOSS builds on this work and does not want to duplicate that effort.

## Question

 Is a Code of Conduct setup to be understood and effective?


## 1. Description

A code of conduct signals to project members what behavior is acceptable. A code of conduct also provides enforcement mechanisms to deal with people who misbehave.


## 2. Sample Objectives

- A project member wants to know that a community takes inclusion seriously.
- A new contributor wants to evaluate a community for inclusive design, before investing any time in that project.
- An event participant wants to evaluate whether an event is safe and/or trustworthy to attend.
- A person wants to identify whether or not their demographic is protected prior to contributing at an event, or participating in a project.
- A grant, or award program wants to ensure that a project/org takes inclusion seriously.
- An open source project, or other technology company/org wants to ensure their partnerships, and allies take D&I seriously as it can impact their own reputation and community health.
- A project member who is faces a violation, needs to understand how to report the behavior.
- A project member, or event participant wants to see who is enforcing the code of conduct; and not just that there is enforcement.


## 3. Sample Strategies

- Identify the location of the COC as it pertains to primary areas of interaction and participation in projects and events. I.e. Repo root, Event entrance, comms channels
- Based on Mozilla’s Code of Conduct Assessment Tool (under development), evaluate the document:
    - If they are using a template like Contributor’s Covenant - have they updated it to reflect their project (or is it just a cut and paste job)
    - Does the purpose statement have any red flags?
    - Is this list of supported groups high quality, minimum or non-existent?
    - Are unacceptable behaviors listed, in a way that provides strong statement fore that project?   Are there any red flags in how these are presented, or who they apply to?
    - Is there clear language, and communicated process about responses, and consequences to unacceptable behavior?  
    - Do reporting details provide individual names as well as groups for reporting? Are there any red flags around the reporting process?  (bonus: can people report in their own language?)
    - Are encouraged behaviors clearly identified? Including  - leadership by example?
    - Is ‘Scope’ of the Code of Conduct clear?  I.e. does it include comms channels, physical spaces, and issue trackers.  Are there red flags about scope? (ie. “this does not apply to core contributor mailing lists”).
    - No ‘Known Problem’ flags i.e. ‘we’re all adults here’.
    - Additional Elements
      - Revision history
      - License
      - Additional Resources
- Survey project members about their perception of how a code of conduct influences their participation, and sense of safety.
- Follow-up survey for reporting, around discoverability, clarity and relevance .


## 4. Sample Success Metrics

### Qualitative
- Document is reviewed according to criteria in strategies, and given a rating:
    - Pass
    - Needs improvement
    - Fail.
- Sentiment in surveys is positive for sentiment of
   - Personal Safety
   - Understanding/Clarity

### Quantitative

Surveys indicate people know there is a CoC, and know where to find it.
In post-report follow-up people indicate CoC was clear, that it helped, and was relevant in their experiences.

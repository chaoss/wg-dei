## Question

**Question:** Does the event empower those who care for children to attend? 

## 1. Description

Family friendliness at events can lower the barrier of entry for attendees with children by allowing them to bring the family. This could include childcare, activities for children, or tracks at the event targeted at youths. 

## 2. Sample Objectives

- An open source project wants to know whether an event is inclusive for attendees who have children.
- An event organizer wants to know whether inviting people who are responsible for children know about the availability of these activities.
- A parent, guardian or caregiver with children under the age of 18, want to know if they can bring their children.
- A parent guardian or caregiver, with children under the age of 18, with no option, but to bring their children, evaluate their ability to attend.

## 3. Sample Strategies
- Analyze conference website.
- Interview conference staff.
- Survey conference participants

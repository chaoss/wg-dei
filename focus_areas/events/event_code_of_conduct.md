## Question

**Question:** Question: How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?

## 1. Description
A code of conduct describes rules of good behavior between event participants and what avenues are available when someone violates those expected good behaviors. An event with a code of conduct sends the signal that the organizers are willing to respond to incidences.

## 2. Sample Objectives
- An event organizer wants to make sure they have effective processes in place to deal with misbehaving attendees.
- An event organizer wants to make sure that participants have a positive experience at the event.
- Event participants want to know how to report offensive behavior. 
- Event participants want to know that they will be safe at an event.

## 3. Sample Strategies
- Observe event website for a code of conduct.
- Observe that code of conduct has a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event.
- Observe that code of conduct/event website provides information about possible ways to provide support victims of inappropriate behaviour, eventually links to external bodies?
- Observe whether a code of conduct is posted at an event.
- Survey participants about the code of conduct.

## 4. Sample Success Metrics

_Qualitative_

- Interview and/or survey participants to understand more about why the event code of conduct did or did not meet their expectations.
  * Sample question: What can this event do to improve the code of conduct at this event?
  * Sample question: What are some examples of how this event met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?

_Quantitative_

- Observe event website for a code of conduct.
- Browse the event website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be discoverable)
- Observe whether a code of conduct is posted at an event.
- As an attendee or event staff, observe whether participants will have an easy time finding a code of conduct posted at the event. Having a code of conduct prominently posted at a registration site may be useful.
- Survey participants about the code of conduct: 
  * Likert scale [1-5] item: How well did the event meet your code of conduct expectations.
  * Sample Question: On registration, and during the event were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate at this event? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]

## Question

**Question:** Are Diversity Access Tickets offered for an event?

## 1. Description

Inviting diverse groups of people may be made explicit by offering specific tickets for them. These tickets may be discounted to add further incentive for members of the invited groups to attend. A popular example are reduced tickets for students.

## 2. Sample Objectives
- Event organizers want to know whether diversity access tickets are effective in increasing diversity at events.
- Attendees may not be able to attend without a discount, due to their economic situation.
- Attendees from underrepresented groups are encouraged to attend.

## 3. Sample Strategies
- Observe website for availability and pricing of diversity access tickets.
- Interview organizers to understand where and how the diversity access tickets were allocated (some organizers offer tickets directly to individuals or local groups focused on underrepresented segments, which cannot always be found by looking at the website).
- Survey participants about perception of diversity access tickets.
- Track attendance numbers based on diversity access tickets.

## 4. Sample Success Metrics
_Qualitative_

- Interview organizers: 
  * How were the diversity access tickets allocated?

_Quantitative_

- Observe website for availability and pricing of diversity access tickets.
- How many (different) diversity access tickets are available?
- Interview organizers:
  * How many (different) diversity access tickets are available?
- Survey participants about perception of diversity access tickets.
  * Likert scale [1-5] item: The availability of discounted student [replace with whatever group was invited] tickets was effective in increasing participation of students [or other group].
_ Track attendance numbers based on diversity access tickets
_ Count at each event, how many diversity access tickets were sold or given out and compare this to how many participants with those tickets sign-in at the event.

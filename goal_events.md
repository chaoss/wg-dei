## Event Diversity

Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion at events.

Name | Question
--- | ---
Speaker Demographics | What is the diversity of speakers? (overall and grouped by keynotes, sessions)
Attendees Demographics | What is diversity of attendees? (for the event overall  grouped by sessions )
Diversity Access Tickets | Are Diversity Access Tickets/scholarships/[other] offered for an event?
Code of Conduct at Event | How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion? [*(Note: we had these sub-bullet points and I think they should go on the detail page for this metric and overarching question, but until we create that page, we can keep them here) Is a Code of Conduct present for an event and visible? Is the Code of Conduct enforced? What is the sentiment towards the Code of conduct? Is the CoC trusted? Do people believe that the CoC is real? What is the readiness to report CoC violations? Are the steps known within minority groups? Do we see real differences in diversity and inclusion when we change the CoC?*]
Kid Friendliness | Does the event host special activities for kids and youths? Mother's room/childcare[more]

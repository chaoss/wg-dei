  - Discussion about having organization diversity
    
      - > Should organizational diversity be part of the D\&I working
        > group? Georg had as an answer from his set of surveys that
        > this specific point was important for D\&I.
    
      - > This specific point was initially not part of the D\&I as
        > people tend to gamify this, but is it important this
        > information? Is more healthy an OSS project lead by a company
        > or by several companies?
    
      - > This is related to the discussion about paid and unpaid
        > developers in a community.
    
      - > Having different companies and different commercial view
        > points helps in the health of the community.
    
      - > We may need a strong rationale for this discussion as having
        > diversity of organizations may be seen as a discussion not
        > related to D\&I
    
      - > Welcoming to volunteers
    
      - > This discussion may be left for the general CHAOSS meetings.
    
      - > **AI Georg**: email D\&I list about pull request

  - Metrics version discussion:
    
      - > How to version the existing metrics?
    
      - > How can we link a specific metric with a specific software
        > release? This working group is kind of working in a continuous
        > way.
    
      - > How can we see the maturity of a metric?
    
      - > D\&I metrics might be that they are less complex than other
        > metrics. 
    
      - > There’s still a diverse set of opinions :).
    
      - > This discussion is related to the Objective 4 at the Goals for
        > 2019 document:
        > [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_rwp6f0teAyXZFkJien7nsmV2FankZDhLk9UmrT48vw/edit\#heading=h.o84ezb8hshgr*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rwp6f0teAyXZFkJien7nsmV2FankZDhLk9UmrT48vw/edit#heading=h.o84ezb8hshgr)
    
      - > **Proposal:** Defer to GMD for versioning procedure.
        > Preference for periodic batch releases of all CHAOSS metrics
        > with a change log since last release.

  -  Revisit and Update goals for 2019
    
      - > Discussion about the document.
    
      - > Why do we have these goals on the table right now? Intro to
        > CHAOSS, Emma’s work, etc.
    
      - > We’ll wait for Emma for further work. Willing to have this
        > discussion during the next Monday meeting.

  -  Metrics repository, are they represented in the D\&I repo
    
      - > [*https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/1\_Diversity-Inclusion.md*](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/1_Diversity-Inclusion.md)
        > 
    
      - > **AI All:** As this repository is going to be removed, we all
        > should be sure that all of the existing metrics in the
        > repository are represented in the D\&I working group.
    
      - > A way to introduce those is to have a new focus area or add
        > metric by metric to each of the existing focus areas.
    
      - > **AI Georg:** create issue to keep track of this.

    anonymous -- issues that were mentioned are the same we’ve talked
    about

Upcoming event:

    importance of mentors & mentorship programs; opportunity to
    highlight the work we’re doing through the CHAOSS Project, might

    focus areas

*From Sean Goggins to Everyone: 06:21 PM*

You could do a custom shortened link that’s meaningful … I think bit.ly
lets you do that .. .and goo.gl as well might

I just made this one for my personal website publication list, for
example: http://bit.ly/Sean-Goggins-Pubs

Agenda** Oct 15, 2018**

Attendance:

Georg, Dawn, Saloni, Nicole, Daniel, Alexander

Team is focused on advancing the content for specific focus areas in
advance of Open Source Summit Europe, to be used within the *Tutorial:
How to Prepare a Diversity & Inclusion Report for Your Community*
session

  - Review WIP to date (e.g. Event Diversity, Governance, Code of
    Conduct & Enforcement, Leadership, and tbd areas from Nicole)
  - Discuss collaboration options for discussions.

Emma is also leading two sessions and will mention CHAOSS work. Sorry I
haven’t shared that yet, because I am behind making slides :S

  - Inclusive Open Governance, What are you Waiting for
  - Metrics that Matter for Diversity & Inclusion

Emma was also invited to speak at Drupalcon in April , and will make
CHAOSS/metric central part of story I share for ‘What Matters for
Inclusion, Matters for Product Innovation’, if someone else wants to
co-submit a proposal for Drupalcon as an actual session, I am sure there
would be interest.

MOSS (Mozilla’s grant program) will be using this[* initial
checklist*](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/evaluation_tools/governance-basic.md),
based on our work. Asking applicants to review as part of applying.

Move to markdown files the existing work in the Google Docs (add
disclaimer about how complete they are or they are not).

Tweets: share slides with Nicole, she will tweet about this.

Next Meeting (any before the Tutorial?)

    mandate
  - Other upcoming events

<!-- end list -->

  - > CHAOSSCon (Feb 1) -- CFP opened, so any amplification would be
    > great

    > to Community devroom or other relevant devrooms. 

Actions:

Agenda Oct 3, 2018

Attendance:

Georg, Emma, Nicole, Matt, Dawn, Scott Lamons, gelliott, sharan 

Shoutouts:  Nicole for organizing our call, and minutes\!

  - Open PRs
    
      - > [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/89*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/89)
        
          - Is CHAOSS going to be opinionated about how our work is used
            ?
          - Solution: don’t call it a ‘process’ but call it
            “considerations”
          - AI: Georg will update the upll request

  - OSS Talks
    
      - > Survey
    
      - > Data & Metrics
    
      - > Open Governance

  - Open Tasks

  - Best strategies to connect existing work ?
    
      - > Inclusivity Bugs
        
          - Contributor Testing
          - Leadership Standards
    
      - > Code of Conduct
        
          - Code of Conduct Assessment Tool (Emma)

**Action Item**.

  - Update PR 89 to be in a Resources folder

  - Create README in Resources folder that describes how to find
    resources
    
      - > In Focus area directories
    
      - > Within this directory
    
      - > External links compiled in a separate file within this
        > directory.
    
      - > Criteria for adding a new resource…. (we want to keep high
        > quality (have an opinion) on what can be added)

  - Based on Dawn’s review of event diversity, we need to answer this
    question:
    
      - > Is “ Sample Success Metrics” the right title, if we are
        > leaning towards this section as being about methods?

  - Let’s agree on what should go under the ‘Resources’ list(s), and the
    level of quality we want from that list so as to ensure it’s highly
    valuable, and relevant to the goals for that area.
    
      - > And a process for adding - that puts burden of resource
        > exploration on the person proposing it.

  - Question: how do we approach overlap between focus areas?

  - Emma working on Code of Conduct, Code of Conduct Enforcement, and
    Leadership to finish by EOD on Oct 12th.

  - Nicole to sign up to complete a few areas (indicate by Monday)

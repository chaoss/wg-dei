      - > Comments from the final editing 
        
          - **\*\*Editability\*\*** — Documentation is easy to update by
            any contributor, including instructions about how to make
            updates. This improves accuracy and clarity of documentation
            from a wide variety of contributors with different skill
            levels.
            
              - > This will move to Documentation Usability (released
                > metric)
        
          - **\*\*Geographic Access\*\*** — Documentation can be
            accessed by users who may be subject to various internet
            restrictions. This may require use of hosted platforms
            instead of x-as-a-service platforms, which may be blocked by
            certain entities or states. 
        
          - **\*\*Mobile Access\*\*** — Documentation can be viewed,
            accessed, and navigated by mobile computing devices or with
            poor broadband connections
            
              - > These will move to Documentation Accessibility 
        
          - **\*\*Portability\*\*** — Documentation is easy to move to
            another format / device.
            
              - > This is simply removed 
        
          - Ask questions regarding readability and scanability such as:
            
            
              - > Does the documentation use organizing constructs, such
                > as:
                
                  - Headings
                  - Text and Code Blocks
                  - Bullets versus Paragraphs
                  - Anchors

FOR Documentation Usability 

  - Provide a quick micro-survey with only one question to readers of
    the documentation (i.e., bottom-page or popup when leaving page):

          - Should these be two different metrics? In the badging
            initiative, we currently treat them sort of as a single
            metric.

          - Being explicit about what is covered specifically for
            speakers (vs attendees)
          - Create separate metric for Speaker Incentives: Speakers
            typically bear an unpaid burden, important part of
            increasing DEI of speakerships, provides opportunities,
            recognizes speakerships as a career booster, ‘travel support
            priority’ could be an additional incentive, extras on top of
            flight/hotel, gifts, stipend

                  - Goal 1: Use our own metrics and identify metrics we
                    are missing, or would benefit from refinement. 
                  - Goal 2: How is CHAOSS doing with respect to D\&I? 
                  - Goal 3: Build a roadmap for CHAOSS moving forward? 
                  - Goal 4: Articulate the process so that others can do
                    the same (CHAOSS initiative?) 
        
          - How do we capture the process through which that reflection
            occurred from the outside without having to reinvent the
            process.

Notes: 

  - Are all metrics that are in the continuous release cycle and have
    passed their review period on the website and the spreadsheet? ---
    the real question is whether there has been comments we need or want
    to address -- the metric stays under review until our next release.

            reach out and tell me he thought our disability related
            questions on our event registration forms were too
            intrusive. I have explained why we collect the data and that
            the questions are 100% optional, confidential and were part
            of a list of recommended questions we received from the
            CHAOSS workgroup, but I also told him I'd research this a
            bit more. Would you mind asking the group what they think? A
            screenshot of these questions is attached.*

          - Question: is the question about accommodating people or just
            interesting to know that we have diversity at the event?

                  - Maybe instead of asking about their disability, ask
                    which accommodations they would like to use.

              - > 
        
          - Question: Where have you reached out to recruit reviewers?
        
          - Goal number of reviewers: 10+
        
          - We currently have reviewers: 3 or 4
        
          - Elizabeth and Matt S have been working on an email to invite
            people.

      - > Managing the notification flood for reviewers
        
          - JWF: Expectation-setting might help with this. I signed up
            to volunteer but was overwhelmed by GitHub emails (even
            though I loved the work -- it was just too much for me to
            keep up with\!)
          - Justin suggest un-watching the repository or the
            organization and relying only on the tagged messages (bot
            auto-tags reviewers when they need to take actions)
    
      - > Experience from Fedora project about Testing new releases

          - *JWF*: I think burnout could be measured, because there is
            often invisible work to a community that is poorly
            understood.
          - *JWF*: I think people who burn out are often doing more work
            than people might realize (not always true, but I think
            often)
    
      - > *Eriol*: but I think some metrics ideas re. Burnout might be:
        > How often a project talks about burnout, has burnout check

          - I know it sounds icky, but I would actually be really
            interested in a number of people that have indicated burnout

Magali Ngouabou**

My name is Magali Ngouabou and I am part of a research team at Carnegie
Mellon University seeking to learn more about familiarity and
accessibility of open source to Black and other underrepresented
individuals to enhance access to employment opportunities through open
source. Can you help us send this survey to the people in your
organization, inviting them to participate in our study? That includes
alums, current participants, program organizers, or anyone else who you
think would be relevant to the study.

Survey link:[
](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7)[*http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7*](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Wk8vBXFfeuxjX7)

Open source refers to the method of creating software in collaborative
spaces such as GitHub, GitLab, etc. Surveys suggest minority
representation in open source is low, but there is virtually no
information on the Black experience in these spaces.

These past few months have been especially difficult on the Black
community, and we fully acknowledge that this research is coming at a
time where the population for this survey is under even more pain and
stress than usual. In light of this, we truly appreciate your support in
connecting with your organization’s members as any insight from the
community would be helpful.

          - Starting with Documentation Utility

**Workspace**:

**May 4 -- date for application, identify mentors for each proposal  
**See [*Season of Docs
Timeline*](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)

**Proposal 1**:

Title: **Write a conceptual overview of CHAOSS D\&I metrics and refactor
existing documentation**

**Description**: Work with CHAOSS D\&I working group members to develop
a conceptual framing for D\&I metrics. The work so far has focused on
defining individual metrics, resulting in much detail that is not
uniformly presented. A technical writer can improve the information
architecture, revise how a reader can drill down into the details, and
make it easier to understand D\&I metrics as a whole. The documentation
would be collected in the CHAOSS D\&I repository and could additionally
be prepared for other dissemination forms to reach a wider audience. 

**Knowledge/Skills Involved**: Being a good human with good ethics.

**Proposal 2**:

**Title**: Build documentation for D\&I Badging project

**Description**: The CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion Badging Program
began as a way to ensure that D\&I metrics can have a significant impact
on the ways that communities function. The aim of the CHAOSS D\&I
Badging program is to bring D\&I metrics into use for propelling good
D\&I practices in different open source systems.

This project will focus on framing documentation for the D\&I Badging
program and aligning it in such a way that it makes sense after
translation. This work would focus on more community-facing docs related
to Badging and also on existing Markdown files.

**Knowledge/Skills Involved**: Citizen of the world with editorial
affinity across languages, GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, HTML
Inlines/Tables, Vector/Raster Image Requirements.

**Aims of the project**: Write and structure D\&I Badging documentation.
Prepare documentation for easy translation.

          - The whole document has become rather complex with all the
            different objectives we identified.
          - It would be good to separate the objectives into logical
            groups and then have matching data collection strategies.
          - the goal is to have more manageable document that does not
            confuse the reader
          - There may be an overlap between the objectives.

      - > GSoC microtasks question. (Posten in
        > badging/diversity-and-inclusion issue \#1)
        
          - In Q 0 of the microtask, there's the term 'software badge'
            which has been used. It is in relation to badges created
            using IMS standards. The question itself is about how the
            IMS standards can be helpful in creating a software
            badge.  I have a doubt about what that term might refer
            to. Does it refer to an independent badge? Or is it more
            like creation of a badge which is associated with a
            particular software's metadata?

Notes:

  - Reflect on Metric Release
    
      - > Take a look at the metric release and think towards the future
        > for next release
    
      - > [*https://chaoss.community/metrics/*](https://chaoss.community/metrics/)
        > 
    
      - > Sponsorship 
        
          - Capacity Differences of contributors
          - How we might want to consider to include capacity
            differences
          - Sponsorship is about empowerment, especially when protégés
            have differences
    
      - > New metrics? 
        
          - [*https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit\#gid=0*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=0)
            
    
      - > How are released metrics being validated and tested?
        
          - Proposal from Emma for a Toolkit:
            [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/252*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/252)
        
          - Maybe ask users of metrics to write a blog post to share
            their experiences.
            
              - > Idea for a blog post series
                > [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm\_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit\#heading=h.i08ikslakwjv*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit#heading=h.i08ikslakwjv)
            
              - > Podcast as another venue for this.
        
          - How are people collecting metrics and feeding them into
            systems for using the metrics?
            
              - > There is currently a disconnect between collecting a
                > metric and how to roll it out and put data back into
                > “the system”
    
      - > Where are the metrics implemented? Augur or GrimoireLab?
        
          - Augur and GrimoireLab are not implementing D\&I metrics
            right now.
          - D\&I Badging would be an implementation in the future
          - Emma’s Toolkit proposal promises to be an easy way for
            people to deploy the metrics in their own projects.

  - D\&I Badging Process (Matt S., and Saleh A. M.)
    
      - > The idea is to give projects who work with D\&I metrics to
        > show recognition on their repos and websites that they are
        > proud to use CHAOSS D\&I metrics. The Badging for events is
        > the next step in which a minimum standard will be ensured.
    
      - > Work will be done in:
        > [*https://github.com/Nebrethar/Docs-Diversity-Inclusion-Badging*](https://github.com/Nebrethar/Docs-Diversity-Inclusion-Badging)
    
      - > The Badging process was thinking to be through a GitHub Issue
        > at first
    
      - > Other approach could be through a pull request, so that we
        > have a permanent history and documentation.
    
      - > Two different badges: (i) for events; (ii) for projects.
    
      - > The templates match up to the released metrics. It seems that
        > we have the basic elements in place.
    
      - > The separation of badges into events and projects makes sense
        > for OpenStack project (Amy’s feedback)
    
      - > When a PR is made, it has two components: 
        
          - 1\. a markdown page that is based on the template
          - 2\. an entry in the list of passing badges (and linking to
            the markdown file)
    
      - > Implementation question? Will we be passing out badges or
        > providing a link?
        
          - How will we make sure that people displaying a badge are
            conforming?
          - We need to explore technical implementation.
          - Possibly use the CII best practices badge app?
          - [*https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects*](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects)
          - We could change the criteria for the D\&I badging
            requirements
          - If we want the PR process, then maybe we could enter a
            project into a customized version of the Best Practices
            Badge system.

  - Consider is the naming of the "Success Metrics" heading
    
      - > Georg suggestion: I'll comment on the "Success Metric" in the
        > template - maybe we can iterate and discuss on the mailing

        > the whole page a metric, e.g., "Speaker Diversity". Within the
        > D\&I WG, we then have multiple ways of measuring this metric
        > with what we call "success metrics". Multiple metrics inside
        > of a single metric can seem confusing.
    
      - > We have "strategies for collecting data" - which is a list
        > like "interviews and surveys" - then we have the "success
        > metrics" that specify how the data is collected through
        > specific interview and survey questions.
    
      - > My proposal is to combine the two sections - we don't need to
        > duplicate the information and can subsume the questions and

Notes:

  - Review of CHAOSScon/OSSNA
    
      - > The **CHAOSScon workshop** (Nicole H., Dawn F., Georg L.) was
        > a full success, we had 3 tables with good engagement advancing
        > the metrics: sponsorship, onboarding, and documentation.
    
      - > The **OSSNA D\&I report tutorial** (Georg L., Nicole H.) had a
        > small audience but good discussion afterwards, especially
        > around how to deal with resistance.
    
      - > The **OSSNA basic CHAOSS introduction session** (Matt G.) had
        > a lot of discussion about D\&I metrics.
    
      - > **AI Georg**: add contributors to readme on repo.

  - Gris Cuevas from ASF had a lightning talk at CHAOSScon about the ASF
    D\&I Initiative. A D\&I survey will be conducted this year to
    measure the status quo at ASF. Interest in advancing D\&I survey
    questions was also voiced throughout OSSNA by different people. We
    may invite everyone to discuss survey design and review our
    metrics.?

          - Suggestion: “What suggestions do you have for improving the
            materials and guidance available to new contributors?” -
            long answer question
    
      - > Q: “Would you like to be contacted to discuss your experiences
        > further?”
        
          - The goal of the question is to see if they would be willing
            to discuss their experience further.
          - Clarify the expectations for what will happen if answer
            “yes” is chosen.
    
      - > **AI Georg:** ask for more survey from other
        > projects/foundations.

  - Angela Brown from LF is very interested in applying D\&I metrics for
    events. 
    
      - > **AI Georg:** Schedule a meeting with Angela and D\&I WG
        > members for reviewing our metrics, developing a data
        > collection strategy, and next steps

  - **AI Matt:** send notes to D\&I mailing list.

  - **AI Georg:** Friday, Georg will send a reminder to the D\&I mailing

Agenda/Notes:

  - CHAOSSCON meeting

  - Shuah talk on D\&I at OSS.

  - Discussion on Mentorship metric

  - Discussion on Communication Inclusivity metric.

Discussion about how to start conversations, how to start a community.
And how to bring new people just starting out of college or changing
careers. How can we help them to be part of the community to create a
community? 

  - There might be issues such as language barriers, engaging into
    discussion, effective communication.

Other aspects of diversity are important as well.

Potential input from Shuah: progress Shuah is doing, experiences and
share specific knowledge and expertise in the area.

**Notes on metrics**:

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/leadership/mentorship.md

**How to gather information in the mentorship**.

Shuah is asking her students about the community:

\* how useful was the community?

\* were people useful for you? 

\* was the community welcoming

She's been collecting quotes after the initial selection after 6 weeks
and then after each of the three evaluation processes during the 12 week
program.

Educating and mentoring new developers. Staying patient while educating
and answering the same questions more than once. Developing FAQ
(Frequently Answered Questions).

\* This is going to be shared in her talk at the OSS Summit San Diego.

Track new contributors for each single release (each three months)

\* Tracking new developers that are women.

\* Did they have any help? Have they been through any mentorship
program? Do they want to mentor? 

\* They want to watch over time the retention angle. Continue
contributing to open source. Do they have an interest in keep
contributing?

\* This depends on the company although this depends.

Track existing documents? How can we keep track what Shuah is doing so
far?

**Communication Inclusivity**.

How to teach English speakers not to use jargon.

This is a big umbrella for effective communication in general. 

If I use jargon, newcomers may not feel comfortable asking for this
meaning in a public channel. Having a specific safe environment where
people can ask freely their specific questions about jargon meaning or
any other type of questions.

Implicit words vs explicit, way of working with the community. Avoid
subjective talks, humor, etc. This is not understood by newcomers.

It’s about empowering people asking questions freely in any channel so
they feel comfortable.

This jargon or tech. Vocabulary does not need to be ‘bad’ or ‘good’ by
itself, but this is a learning path. This is like moving to a new place
where you have to learn where things and places are. And how to bring
your own uniqueness to the place.

          - While these may not be direct 1-to-1 correlation of the
            CHAOSS metrics being deployed within a project, they
            demonstrate the impact that the CHAOSS D\&I workgroup is
            having in a short period of time

      - **Question:** How does the Code of Conduct for events support
        diversity and inclusion?
      - **Question:** How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support
        diversity and inclusion for an event?

Note: 

  - KubeCon - 25-30 people at the panel. Covered historical details to
    chaoss. Discussed experience with building communities.
    
      - > Panelists: Dawn Foster, Jonas Rosland, Nicole Huesman,
        > Guinevere Saenger, Daniel Izquierdo, 

  - Attendee question: How to have an inclusive event in spite of
    regional culture? Organizer received rejections for inviting diverse
    speakers. 
    
      - > For people who are new to your country. Maybe provide a
        > translator to bridge any language barrier.
    
      - > Security; Help with transfers from airport. Offer group
        > outings.
    
      - > (Maybe add a CHAOSS metric around event safety)

  - Last week was InnerSource Spain meeting. Several CHAOSS members also
    talked about CHAOSS there.

  - We need to start focusing on releasing metrics. Review and accept
    metrics for release.

  - Organize a hackathon to polish existing metrics or produce new
    metrics (perhaps send some details to the mailing list to welcome
    everyone to join this).
    
      - > AI Georg will send an email to invite people.

          - **AI Georg:** Break out metric into its components: Common
            Metric, Contributor Community Diversity, and Recognition of
            Good Work
    
      - > Right now, we have too much in here and are juggling too many
        > parts
        
          - Component 1 (**Common Metric**): How to obtain contribution
            types and which contribution types exist is a universal
            problem that can live in the Common Metrics WG. Other WGs
            may have different angles on it and ask for example "How
            active is the community across contribution types"
          - Component 2 (**Recognition of Good Work**): We have
            contribution types in the focus area Recognition of Good
            Work and should create a document that tailors the metric
            specifically to recognition.
          - Component 3 (**Contributor Community Diversity**): We also
            have contribution types in the focus area Contributor
            Community Diversity and should create a document that
            tailors the metric specifically to understanding the
            diversity of our community members across contribution types

        > sponsorship? Is sponsorship less technical in nature? Geog
        > believes sponsorship is geared toward getting members more
        > involved but is less technical. More thoughts here:

      - > Georg: Sponsor gives access to their own network, think of it
        > as push and pull. Mentor pushes the mentee to be more active

        > increase their visibility.

        > we have a focus area with 2 out of 5 metrics well developed,
        > we can …
        
          - 1\. We can have a generic disclaimer in each incomplete
            focus area, that there are more under development and they
            can be found on the repository
            
              - > Way to get more contributors who are interested in
                > helping to develop incomplete metrics.
        
          - 2\. We can hold back the other 3 metrics for future
            releases.
        
          - 3\. We can include undeveloped metrics with a disclaimer
            that they are undeveloped.
    
      - > Should we focus on a specific metric for the first release?
        
          - We should do a walk-through of the focus areas and metrics
            to identify the “level of completeness”.
          - Then, we can decide whether to focus on the focus-areas that
            have the most complete OR to focus on metrics that could
            populate a less well developed focus area.
          - We will put this on next week’s agenda and prior discuss
            this on the mailing list.

          - HL decentralized identity management with Indy, incorporate
            methods for reporting on D\&I. Once deployed with this tool,
            it will be available to other communities. 
          - First trial with Hyperledger community.
          - Next step is to meet with the Indy team

            involved, would be good to document this and post it so we
            can point people to it. Good discussion to also post to
            mailing list for wider input and further discussion.

          - D\&I 3 Focus Areas This Year 1) evolve the metrics based on
            community input, continue to work on them, 2) application of
            the metrics and the pilot projects and 3) socialization,
            promotion of the successes, increase visibility for CHOASS

          - Created awareness, different workgroups presented
        
          - Around 15 people attended 
        
          - Lots of discussion on D\&I, pilot use cases 
        
          - Lots of focus on Risk, what direction these metrics should
            take? 
            
              - > How did we come up with these metrics? goal, question,

  - CHAOSS Community Handbook: within growing CHAOSS, newcomers, don’t
    know history, especially for someone new it can be difficult, not a
    lot documented with roles and responsibilities. 

  - Community Handbook idea - GitLab has published all their operations.
    Idea is to adopt that for CHAOSS and document how we operate. 

  - Several willing to help write it.

      - > **AI Georg:** Start conversations on the CHAOSS mailing list
        > on topics that bleed over from the weekly calls.
        
          - This is ongoing and Georg has it on his agenda.
    
      - > **AI Matt + Kevin:**
        > [*https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/118*](https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/118)

          - Wednesday afternoon seems to work for everyone.
            
              - > We may require some phone connection.
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Reach out to Uber and invite them to OSLS
        > meeting as well
        
          - When are we having this meeting?
          - Shall we have a meetup during the OSLS? Uber might be
            invited to this meeting.
          - **AI Sarah** will check with the TLF team to double check if
            there are BOFs
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Create a pull request that add people who
        > contributed at CHAOSScon as contributors
        
          - [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/168*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/168)
          - Daniel to check this with the Eventbrite info.
    
      - > **AI Sarah:** confirm with everyone that the switch from
        > Daniel to Jamie is okay for the OSLS panel.
        
          - Done. Reflected in the program.
          - Georg may introduce part of the data.
    
      - > **AI Sarah:** Update panelist bio section on OSLS schedule.
        > Georg replaces Matt, Jamie replaces Daniel.
        
          - Done. Reflected in the program.
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** Schedule a OSLS panel planning meeting.
        > Strategy for fitting this many people in a 30 minute panel.
        
          - Done.
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** Send email to overall CHAOSS mailing list to
        > start review process for README.
        
          - Done.
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** Submit PR with new readme file and review at
        > next meeting. 
        
          - Ongoing.

  - Open Source Leadership Summit:
    
      - > Are there any topics we’d like to discuss about?
    
      - > Cancelling next week meeting?
        
          - This is cancelled because many of us are travelling to the
            OSLS
          - **AI Matt**: Send next meeting cancellation.

  - Updates on RH/BU D\&I Interns
    
      - > Emmanuel: They already have a couple of people to work on the
        > D\&I (have a look at previous notes from previous meetings)
    
      - > Langdon: Giving them background work. They hope to start the
        > week after next. 
    
      - > Questions: other ways to connect interns in addition to these
        > calls? Other ways to be proactive?
        
          - They’ll be given a bunch of resources (CHAOSS, D\&I in
            general). This is an onboarding process. Metrics for D\&I
            focus.
          - Connecting with the technology might be hard, but mentors
            have already started to talk to Sean about Augur.
          - They may send emails to the mailing lists.

  - Metrics around pull request
    
      - > Emmanuel, they were having a look at the metrics in CHAOSS,
        > contributions types, how to make a PR. They didn’t find a
        > proper way to include some metrics without moving things
        > around.
    
      - > Dawn: not all of the metrics might be part of D\&I. There are
        > other groups such as the commons working group, GMD, Risk, and
        > others. It might be worth having a look at this.
    
      - > Langdon: It was unclear the relationship between the overall
        > metrics and the D\&I metrics and how they relate to each
        > other. Was this intended?
        
          - Example of those metrics: responsiveness metrics such as
            time to xxx.
    
      - > There’s a document that they’ll share with the community to
        > have a look at and help with the process.
        
          - CHAOSS is still doing work in progress in terms of
            structuring all of the metrics and across all of the working
            groups.
    
      - > Example of metrics: communication channels and sentiment and
        > inclusivity in those channels. 

  - Determine the March 18th meeting facilitator and notetaker 
    
      - > Facilitator: Nicole as tentative facilitator
    
      - > Notetaker: Sarah Conway

  - OSLS panel
    
      - > Nicole will moderate the panel.
    
      - > Potential recommendations:
        
          - Slide with panelist introductions.
          - 1 Question per panelist and then there’s time for extra
            questions from the audience.

            Strategy for fitting this many people in a 30 minute panel.
    
      - > **AI Sarah:** Setup meeting with Hyperledger and CHAOSS D\&I
        
          - Ongoing. Hyperledger team meets internally first. 
          - At OSLS, include a remote join option for people who can’t
            be at the meeting
          - Hyperledger is very interested in using D\&I metrics.
            Working internally to get started, evaluating how to use
            CHAOSS metrics effectively and how to contribute back.
          - Invite for meeting at OSLS will come later this week.

          - The metrics chosen by BU students are: Communication and
            Pull Requests
          - BU goal is to implement with Augur and GrimoireLab and
            document different visualization and representation options.
          - BU has three part-time interns.
          - BU project may extend into summer and fall as an ongoing
            project for students to accomplish goals. Summer interns
            would be full-time.
          - **AI BU project: **Provides updates on weekly D\&I call.
    
      - > Decision: Wait for BU project to evolve and evaluate how much
        > work goes into mentoring before we add more interns.

      - > Georg is replacing Matt 
    
      - > We can come up with some questions for the panel. If it makes

      - > Maybe we need a package or document on “how to get started
        > with D\&I metrics”
    
      - > Three possible methods:
        
          - CHAOSS D\&I members do the work of implementing D\&I metrics
            for communities. E.g., produce a gender report for a
            community
          - We have an Outreachy or other intern who does the D\&I
            implementation
          - CHAOSS D\&I members as consultants, providing guidance to a
            project, providing help but not doing work ourselves.
          - Find sponsoring (open call?) to have a full-time dedicated
            CHAOSS D\&I person who can be a liaison with projects

  - Outreachy intern follow up
    
      - > **AI Georg + Matt:** prepare a project description

  - BU + Red Hat Open Source Inclusion Update
    
      - > Two weeks ago, BU + Red Hat had a round table on what metrics
        > they wanted to work on
        > ([*graphic*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HEtALiey93CCPYALeDLWLj6DuepDqF_/view?usp=sharing)).
        > Through a voting, two metrics were surfaced that the team is
        > thinking about working on. Question is now, whether the CHAOSS
        > D\&I Working Group has feedback on these metrics.
    
      - > Metrics would be integrated with Augur
    
      - > 1\. Metric: Communication channels + sentiment
        
          - Not yet defined in CHAOSS D\&I WG
          - [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/project-and-community/channels.md*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/project-and-community/channels.md)
          - Good starting point, needs defining, space for innovation
            and students can shape the outcome
    
      - > 2\. Metric: Pull requests and reviews on GitHub
        
          - Might be related to focus area “Recognition of Good Work” 
          - [*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/focus-areas/recognition*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/focus-areas/recognition)

          - 
    
      - > Next steps: Dive into the metrics and what can be collected.
        > Talk to Augur about how already collected metrics can be used
        > for D\&I metrics. 
    
      - > Suggestion: Identify the goal first, irrespective of metric.
        > Work through several steps to work towards a metric. (Avoid
        > limiting search to metrics based on already available data).

  - Review last week’s action items:

    Langdon, Sarah Conway, Emmanuel Amponsah, Matt Germonprez, Nicole
    Huesman, Kevin Lumbard

  - Review last week’s Action Items
    
      - > **AI Nicole: **Describe better how to get involved. Expand the
        > CONTRIBUTING.md
        
          - Open - postpone until next week 
    
      - > **AI All:** Weigh in on the structure by next week, using
        > comments in the Google Doc. **AI Nicole:** Send email to list
        > to ask for feedback on readme structure.
        
          - Posted to mailing list for feedback. A few comments were
            made on the document. Discussed more in later agenda item
    
      - > **AI Georg:** create new pull request
        > ([*https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/158*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/158))
        
          - Sarah: Paid and non-paid adds more clarity
          - Sharan: tried to capture this too and saw it as a
            distinction worth capturing
          - Dawn: incredibly important to capture, need to consider how
            the info. Is used
          - Agreed to use language, Dawn to go ahead and merge 
    
      - > **AI Matt**: Look for funding for outreachy / GSoC
        
          - Matt: Not much luck with funding. 
          - Involve someone who can help us polish what we have, use
            cases that we have, work with more projects to implement
            metrics, could use someone to collect the information, write
            engaging blog posts. 
          - Red Hat and Linux Foundation may be able to support this in
            future. Red Hat has money earmarked for a project we have
            with Open Source & D\&I (and funds Outreachy interns in
            general). Would need more specifics - one paragraph - on
            what is needed. 
          - **AI Georg + Matt:** prepare a project description
    
      - > **AI Georg:** Create a Pull Request to add contributors to
        > readme
        
          - Done
    
      - > **AI Daniel:** Create a pull request that add people who
        > contributed at CHAOSScon as contributors
        
          -  Open

  - Discussion on potential new use cases for the D\&I use cases (e.g.:
    Hyperledger). \[Objective \#1\]
    
      - > What needs to happen for Hyperledger to become a pilot
        > project?
        
          - Examples OpenStack - Daniel’s suggestion is to start with
            one focus area, the one most useful, easiest and move
            forward. Data for governance, for example, is it useful for
            the board, community. Will it help the board make decisions,
            become more inclusive. 
        
          - Nicole: Hyperledger interested in doing D\&I work, measuring
            it, follow OpenStack example. 
        
          - Daniel: we don’t know how much work involved in a use case
            from both sides - start small with one focus area. 
        
          - Nicole: initial D\&I work had deadlines around OpenStack
            Summits, writing blogs around the work. Event specific to
            Hyperledger community. 
        
          - Sarah: Hyperledger events in 2019 - what can project commit
            to, focus on? Might be an opportunity for D\&I focus. 
        
          - Nicole: OpenStack reports covered majority of metric
            categories in CHAOSS D\&I work. 
        
          - Understand Hyperledger goals and how they match to CHAOSS
            D\&I goals. Copied from WG repo:
            
              - > Goal: Identify how we are communicating with
                > contributors, and potential contributors.
            
              - > Goal: Identify the diversity of the contributions
                > within a community, and how those different
                > contributions are valued.
            
              - > Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion at events.
        
          - CHAOSS D\&I serve as consultants for Hyperledger project
            once goals identified. 
        
          - **AI Sarah:** Contact Hyperledger project and discuss which
            focus group is most interesting for the project to start
            with. 
        
          - **AI Sarah:** Schedule an in-person meeting at OSLS. Dawn
            will be there, happy to help. 
        
          - Georg: Is there anything CHAOSS D\&I should do/prepare? 
        
          - Sarah: Is there any success from OpenStack that exists to
            share? 
        
          - Nicole: Is there one case study to share? We don’t have that
            yet. Point to the different blogs about the OpenStack
            Report. Share this with Hyperledger team/members.

  - Mailing list discussion about the readme plus cohesion with the GMD
    WG. \[Objective \#5, KR2\]
    
      - > [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVtYHNTwrGFV3UyiR2qBKV0MvipoEEI-fbwavSNui4Q/edit*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVtYHNTwrGFV3UyiR2qBKV0MvipoEEI-fbwavSNui4Q/edit)
    
      - > Nicole: received good feedback on revised structure of ReadMe
        > file. Goal is to finalize structure to put together content
        > for new ReadMe file. By OSLS, new ReadMe file in place. 
    
      - > Matt: Good goal to finalize new structure regardless of
        > content, good to share with other WGs. 
    
      - > Review of changes, feedback. 
        
          - Georg: suggest moving background section down lower, metrics
            up top. 
          - Nicole: suggest others share how they contribute so that
            others will understand quickly what we are doing and how to
            get involved. 
          - Georg: it is important, but if you are completely metrics
            are important. 
          - Dawn: will metrics be confusing without a lot of context?
            That was argument for putting it down lower. 
          - Matt: how to get involved, showcase that as a use case and
            then people who might not really want to get involved but
            might want to know how to use the metrics for their own
            project. 
          - Sarah: trying to reach two audiences, both important. 
          - Dawn: Ben had best practices on this. 
          - Georg: a sentence on purpose, goals, outcomes, process, then
            link to section below. So when you are new to ReadMe get
            high-level view quickly.
          - Is Comm and Contribution in the right place (lower at spot
            13)? George that is where I expect to see them. Dawn: read
            about goals before jumping into contributing to better
            understand if they want to contribute. Resolved this is the
            right place for it. 
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** communicate with Ben on D\&I ReadMe file and
        > move content into these sections. 
    
      - > **AI Nicole:** Submit PR with new readme file and review at
        > next meeting. 

  - Determine next week’s meeting February 18:
    
      - > Facilitator: Daniel
    
      - > Notetaker: Georg

  - Subdomain for metrics release (Proposal: di.chaoss.community)
    \[Objective \#5, KR1\] 
    
      - > Relates to infrastructure proposal:
        > [*https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/issues/125*](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/issues/125)
    
      - > Georg: How to release metrics? Have list of released metrics
        > on website? Something more accessible and easier to read than
        > info. In GitHub. Manually curated list of metrics. List would
        > link out to definitions with our pages. Make them more
        > pleasing to eye-GitHub template that looks more like website,
        > automatically updated. 
    
      - > Dawn: will we do 3 separate pages? Or a reason we wouldn’t
        > combine? 
    
      - > Georg: yes because we have 3 different repos. 
    
      - > Dawn: any page that aggregates? 
    
      - > Georg: Yes. 
    
      - > Further discussion postponed.

  - \[Objective \#5, KR1\] Advancing metrics from CHAOSScon workshop
    
      - > Postponed.

(Emma)

Sorry I can’t stay today.

I wanted to circle back on the [*contribution type work from
Georg*](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/pull/153), and
conversation. And I am wondering, if we’re sometimes creating metrics
that we need, because they don’t exist in CHAOSS yet... so that we can
then apply the d\&I lens. And this might add bloat to or repo/content.

Basically, if someone new were to look across CHAOSS, for metrics that
involve contribution would D\&I be an obvious choice? I’m not sure. 
What I am suggesting we discuss, is how we abstract d\&I from other
metrics. We can still build them, just deliberate about where.

\*hopes this is translates, and makes sense in text\* - 

Georg: Thanks Emma, I will add contribution type to our agenda

Agenda** Oct 15, 2018**

Attendance:

Georg, Dawn, Saloni, Nicole, Daniel, Alexander

Team is focused on advancing the content for specific focus areas in
advance of Open Source Summit Europe, to be used within the *Tutorial:
How to Prepare a Diversity & Inclusion Report for Your Community*
session

  - Review WIP to date (e.g. Event Diversity, Governance, Code of
    Conduct & Enforcement, Leadership, and tbd areas from Nicole)
  - Discuss collaboration options for discussions.

Emma is also leading two sessions and will mention CHAOSS work. Sorry I
haven’t shared that yet, because I am behind making slides :S

  - Inclusive Open Governance, What are you Waiting for
  - Metrics that Matter for Diversity & Inclusion

Emma was also invited to speak at Drupalcon in April , and will make
CHAOSS/metric central part of story I share for ‘What Matters for
Inclusion, Matters for Product Innovation’, if someone else wants to
co-submit a proposal for Drupalcon as an actual session, I am sure there
would be interest.

MOSS (Mozilla’s grant program) will be using this[* initial
checklist*](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/evaluation_tools/governance-basic.md),
based on our work. Asking applicants to review as part of applying.

Move to markdown files the existing work in the Google Docs (add
disclaimer about how complete they are or they are not).

Tweets: share slides with Nicole, she will tweet about this.

Next Meeting (any before the Tutorial?)

          - Is CHAOSS going to be opinionated about how our work is used
            ?
          - Solution: don’t call it a ‘process’ but call it
            “considerations”

**Action Item**.

  - Update PR 89 to be in a Resources folder

  - Create README in Resources folder that describes how to find
    resources
    
      - > In Focus area directories
    
      - > Within this directory
    
      - > External links compiled in a separate file within this
        > directory.
    
      - > Criteria for adding a new resource…. (we want to keep high
        > quality (have an opinion) on what can be added)

  - Based on Dawn’s review of event diversity, we need to answer this
    question:
    
      - > Is “ Sample Success Metrics” the right title, if we are
        > leaning towards this section as being about methods?

  - Let’s agree on what should go under the ‘Resources’ list(s), and the
    level of quality we want from that list so as to ensure it’s highly
    valuable, and relevant to the goals for that area.
    
      - > And a process for adding - that puts burden of resource
        > exploration on the person proposing it.

  - Question: how do we approach overlap between focus areas?

  - Emma working on Code of Conduct, Code of Conduct Enforcement, and
    Leadership to finish by EOD on Oct 12th.

  - Nicole to sign up to complete a few areas (indicate by Monday)

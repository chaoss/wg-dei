New ***Detail page*** for each line e.g.: Documentation ---- specify how
to answer the question.

Documentation is codified knowledge. Documentation can be on the
processes and practices of the community, thus empowering participants
to contribute with certainty for how and why things are happening.
Documentation can be on the artifacts produced by the community and as
such empower participants to know where to contribute and what kind of
contributions further the goals of the community.

*Sample Objectives*:

  - (Accessibility Screen Reader)Documentation is accessible according
    to x standard for screen readers (which tool to use?)
  - (Awareness) Documentation is findable
  - (Clarity) Documentation is easy to follow and structured intuitively
  - (Relevance) Documentation is regularly updated
  - (Relevance) Environment builds are up to date
  - (Non-Technical Accessibility) Documentation limits use of
    unnecessary technical jargon
  - (Information Amount) Documentation provides information so that
    people gather as much information as they want, and no more than
    they want
  - (Learning by Doing) Documentation encourages hands-on learning, but
    doesn’t require it
  - (Learning by Process) Documentation provides not only details of
    every step, but also how these steps fit together in the process
  - (Inclusion) Documentation does not include non-inclusive language
    (this could be ‘brogrammer’ language, or exclusionary/derogatory
    language.
  - (FOSS standards) README & CONTRIBUTING files provide intended
    information

*Sample Strategies*:

  - A person goes through the documentation and checks off criteria
    listed below.
  - Gather feedback from new community members using below survey
    questions.
  - Include a quick survey (“was this page helpful”) at the bottom of
    every page.
  - Use the GenderMag Heuristics to evaluate the document’s
    gender-inclusivity.
    ([*http://gendermag.org/downloadables/GM-Heuristics-2018-0704.pdf*](http://gendermag.org/downloadables/GM-Heuristics-2018-0704.pdf)
    )

*Sample Metrics*: 

**Qualitative

  - > Is the documentation screen reader friendly? 
    
      - TODO: link to a tool that evaluates this. 
      - TODO: provide an interpretation guide for the output of the
        tool.

  - > Gender-inclusivity:
    
      - TODO: what result will indicate good diversity and inclusion?
        
          - > “Score” on the GenderMag Heuristics (count of how many
            > supported out of 5)
        
          - > “Score” on the “Sample Objective” list (count of how many
            > supported out of the length of the list)

  - > Interview with newcomers to find out how documentation helped (a)
    > understand the contribution process and/or (b) help complete the
    > task
    
      - TODO: write specific questions that can be asked of the newcomer
      - TODO: provide an analysis method for the questions
      - TODO: decide what kind of answers signal good diversity and
        inclusion

Quantitative

  - > Quick bottom-page survey 
    
      - TODO: add specific questions 
      - TODO: ways to analyze them.
      - Check the wiki last-updated date (to satisfy recent/current)

<span id="anchor-166"></span>**Category: Diversity and Inclusion**

Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion within a project.

<span id="anchor-167"></span>**Definitions**

  - **Diversity**: How different are the people present?
  - **Inclusion**: How well do we enable these different people to work
    together?
  - **Retention**: How long do different people stay engaged?
  - **Attraction**: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?

*Example 1:* Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they don’t
have to work together or be there still tomorrow. AND just because
someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience is good.

*Example 2:* Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we want to
measure their degree of visibility/outness? (e.g., disability,
socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)

*Example 3:* There may be women within a community that is less
inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through” and
participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily reflect the
level of inclusion within a community.

I want to flag that we should have criteria / ethics /legal for each of
these, and when they should be asked. (Intentionality of asking
questions) . legal = asking PID + gender spectrum

<span id="anchor-168"></span>**Dimensions of Demographics**

1.  **Self-identified perceived-minority (what ever that means)**

2.  Gender Identity
    
    1.  > Spectrum 
    
    2.  > Identify as transgender

3.  Age / e.g., youths? 

4.  Location/Region/Country

5.  Access to Technology aka (sub for education)

6.  Interest (Passion) 

7.  Socio economic status

8.  Tenure (time with project) / Tenure with the ecosystem

9.  Race/Ethnicity

10. First Language

11. Confidence with English

12. Disability

13. Neurodiversity

14. Sexual orientation

15. Caregiver
    
    1.  > Parents with children
    
    2.  > Eldercare
    
    3.  > 

The approach NumFOCUS has recently been taking is “Do you identify as a
minority in the scientific computing community?” And if yes, then “along
which dimensions?” and we give many of the types of options listed
above, including “prefer not to say.”

How to ensure metrics are not gamed?
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law>)

What are the unintended consequences of providing these measurements?

How can we make sure people understand the metrics correctly and draw
problematic conclusions?

Next:

  - One pull request per section, to facilitate discussions focused on
    each section. (Emma and Daniel)
  - Write a blog post to circulate this? (Emma)

<span id="anchor-178"></span>*Proposed Goals*

Review the following 5 goals for CHAOSS, add in the work your
organization is already doing.

  - Add in any existing work (of any magnitude) , you are doing that
    would fall under this goal.
  - Add in comments or suggestions regarding the goals themselves.
  - Add your name to the ‘consulted’ list once you are finished with
    feedback (so we know if we are missing anyone)

<span id="anchor-179"></span>\#1 A set of generic goal-questions-metrics
curated by the community focused on understanding and measuring
diversity & inclusion

Generic means here that we have a baseline of questions but how we can
answer them has to tailored to unique community contexts. However, we
want to learn from those unique differences.

Generic goals are to understand diversity and inclusion in the
categories (buckets) of:

***Definitions:***

  - Diversity: How different are the people present?

  - Inclusion: How well do we enable these different people to work
    together?

  - Retention: How long do different people stay engaged?

  - Attraction: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?
    
      - > Example: Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they
        > don’t have to work together or be there still tomorrow. AND
        > just because someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience
        > is good.
    
      - > Example: Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we
        > want to measure their degree of visibility/outness?
        > (disability, socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)... 
    
      - > Example: There may be women within a community that is less
        > inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through”
        > and participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily
        > reflect the level of inclusion within a community.

(Meta) but ensuring these measurements, assessments are built into
software and volunteer lifecycles.

\- AS: are all events the same? Hackathons? Project meetings?

\- leadership

\- Do the contributions show diversity and inclusion?

\- Does the governance of a community foster diversity and inclusion?

Maybe, similar to:
<https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/1_Diversity-Inclusion.md>

<span id="anchor-180"></span>Comments on the status of the current set
of 5 goals of the CHAOSS D\&I working group.

  - This goal aligns with the CHAOSS metrics committee work. This goal
    also aligns with my work on understanding metrics, specifically it
    informs the diversity and inclusion metrics. I can bridge the work
    in the working group with the metrics working group. - Georg Link

  - **Understanding & Measuring (Emma - Mozilla)**

        > And working on more

  - Daniel - Bitergia
    
      - > One of the first goals when producing the OpenStack gender
        > report was to understand the technical contributions of women

      - > Our approach is to use a Goal-Question-Metric approach that
        > helps in first place to focus the analysis (eg: understand the
        > gender diversity of the technical and non-technical
        > contributions of a given community), then the questions (eg:
        > what is the population of women participating in Git? What’s
        > the population of women participating in Gerrit? How many of
        > them are actually reviewing code? How many of them are core

      - > The initial goal of the analysis was based on feedback from

<span id="anchor-181"></span>\#2 Second learn good practices from open
source communities on improving their diversity and inclusion

  - To provide actionable good practices is the logical next step of
    providing metrics. I have a personal interest in learning about good
    practices and it also informs my academic work. - Georg Link

  - We are working to do this via D\&I in Open Source Call which can
    facilitate this**(Emma, Mozilla) **

  - Daniel - Bitergia
    
      - > As we were covering in the first step the ‘awareness’ of the
        > community and in second place the question ‘what to measure’.
        > Our third goal was to understand and include other results to
        > start making decisions on the existing data. This step was
        > focused on bringing other experiences to the working group, so
        > we were able to have a better perspective of what D\&I means
        > and the approaches that people are following with this
        > respect.

  - Alexander; are we looking at activities targeting the communities
    themselves or also reaching outside of the (current) communities,
    e.g., Summer of Code-like initiatives, outreach at schools?

<span id="anchor-182"></span>\#3 Produce useful software to measure
diversity from a quantitative point of view. This is expected to produce
generic software to analyze several repositories of information such as
Git repositories or Mailing lists

  - This goal aligns with the CHAOSS software committee. Producing such
    software (or other tools) also informs the metrics that we
    contribute to the CHAOSS metrics committee. - Georg Link

  - We are investing in the next phase of FOSS Heartbeat (sentiment
    analysis in Github, could be applied to other software - and we
    might have budget to invest in that) **(Emma, Mozilla)**

  - Daniel - Bitergia
    
      - > The software produced was pretty focused on the OpenStack
        > case. However, this could be generalize for other communities
        > quite easily. Indeed GrimoireLab already supports gender
        > analysis, and GrimoireLab already supports around 30 data
        > sources. This means that in a quick way, Grimoirelab can
        > populate databases (from a quantitative point of view) of
        > those 30 data sources and produce panels with gender
        > information for each of those.
    
      - > GrimoireLab adds and enriches existing information with third
        > party APIs such as genderize.io. This means that GrimoireLab
        > is currently providing the infrastructure to retrieve and have
        > a first dataset with that data. What GrimoireLab does not take
        > into account is the ‘quality’ of such data and this depends on
        > the user of the platform. There are cases where names need to
        > be updated. GrimoireLab helps with that process, but do not
        > provide 100% real data with respect to gender info.
    
      - > However, GrimoireLab is able to produce databases in a quick
        > way for thousands of developers at the same time (eg: the
        > OpenStack database contains \>10K different identities).

  - Alexander
    
      - > We have multiple sources of info in addition to git
        > repositories and mailing lists (StackOverflow, code review
        > systems, bug trackers, meeting logs…). 

<span id="anchor-183"></span>\#4 Good practices on how to deal with such
data, maintain and ways of collaboration with open source communities.

  - This goal is a necessary consequence of collecting data and the work
    group can provide the forum to exchange and document these good
    practices. - Georg Link

  - We are working on strategy for handling data, including thresholds
    for when we visualize data that includes certain demographics.
    **(Emma ,Mozilla)**

  - We are also asking hard questions about consent, and access to data.
    For example if people have not consented to their data being used in
    genderize.io should we be doing it?  If people give us their PII,
    and we use it to collect information about the , should we be asking
    for consent to do that when we collect their PII? (probably) (Emma,
    Mozilla)

  - Daniel - Bitergia
    
      - > The way we’re handling the data is to give private access to
        > certain members of the OpenStack analysis. As we’re dealing
        > with private data, this should have restricted access.
        > However, we have not found a proper way to let the community
        > improve themselves the datasets.

  - Alexander
    
      - > There are some generic recommendations on handling personal
        > data

<span id="anchor-184"></span>\#5 A method that other communities can
reproduce the report for themselves.

  - This goal aligns with the overall CHAOSS mission. - Georg Link

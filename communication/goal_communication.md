--- | ---
Listening | How well do our mechanisms for listening accommodate community? i.e. text-based for asking questions where bandwidth is a challenge.
Speaking | Are we speaking to our communities in an accessible range?  (i.e. Non-English Speakers, captioning, age group)
Mode Alternatives | What alternative communication modes do we offer, e.g. text alternatives to video?
Captioning | Do we provide text captioning for spoken communication?
Technical Jargon |   ? placeholder to say - language can skew to technical-confidence vrs technical ability.  How can we measure that?

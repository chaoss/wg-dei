# Open Leadership Principles
[Based on Mozilla's Volunteer Leadership 2018  - Shared Agreements](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/what-s-next-for-volunteer-leadership-in-2018-shared-agreements/25091)


1. **Informal, and formal leadership roles with influence on people and product should should have cycles of review and renewal.**

We recognize that gatekeeping is a symptom of unchecked, and tenured leadership in open communities.  We also recognize that good leaders become great leaders with opportunity to give and receive constructive feedback.

   * This creates opportunities for new, diverse leaders to emerge
   * Ensures continuous support from the communities they serve
   * Prevents toxic individuals from maintaining power indefinitely
   * Creates space for individuals to receive feedback and support to better thrive in their role

2. **Responsibilities should be clearly communicated and distributed**
By surfacing responsibilities of leadership we create a culture of openness and accountability - distributing that authority ensures diversity of perspective, experiences and opportunities for growth and influence.

   * Creates more opportunities for more people
   * Avoids gatekeeping and power accumulation
   * Reduces burnout and over reliance on an individual by sharing accountability
   * Creates leadership pathways for new people
   * Potentially increases diversity
   * An emphasis on responsibility over title avoids unnecessary “authority labels”


3. **People in leadership roles should lead by example values in the Code of Conduct/Community Participation Guidelines**
Leveraging community code of conduct, leadership demonstrates and models positive behaviors of inclusion.  

   * Creates a culture of inclusion that invites participation from new voices
   * Encourages the inclusion of diverse voices and groups
   * Creates an environment where the CoC/CPG is understood & applied consistently
   * Enables leadership pathways that explicitly consider inclusion dimensions

5. **People with leadership roles should be supported and recognized in a set of standard ways across Mozilla**

   * Enables people to have equal access to training and growth opportunities regardless of what part of the project they contribute to
   * Allows people to follow their passions/skills instead of just reward
   * Roles have clear definitions and avoid labels that create authority feeling.
  *  We get shared understandings of the kinds of responsibilities that exist.

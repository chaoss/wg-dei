## Background

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to the health of open source communities. The CHAOSS Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Working Group aims to define metrics and methods to help others measure and center diversity, equity, and inclusion in their own Open Source projects. The CHAOSS DEI Working Group establishes and broadly communicates an ethical, peer-validated, research-informed, set of standards and best practices for measuring diversity, equity, and inclusion in Open Source projects. We invite anyone interested in the topic of diversity, equity, and inclusion to learn more, and join us. See [Contributing](#contributing) below to become part of our community.

## Contributing

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity, equity, and inclusion. And this includes several areas of work such as **diversity, equity, and inclusion** from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, **Python** development,
**tech writing**, people interested in **speaking** at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but we’ve provided a few steps as good starting points:

- Introduce yourself on the [CHAOSS DEI WG mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss-diversity-inclusion), and tell us a little bit about your interests.
- Join us on our weekly video conferences. 
- Come see us at upcoming [conferences and workshops](https://chaoss.community/community/#user-content-upcoming-events).
- Review the Metrics Focus Areas and provide your feedback.
- Review the [issue list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues) and fix some of the issues.
- Review the [metric template](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/resources/metrics-template.md) to create a new metric.

# CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion Working Group


## Introduction

Diversity and inclusion are central to the health of open source communities. The CHAOSS Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Working Group aims at bringing experiences to measure diversity and inclusion consistently across open source projects, supported by software where possible. 

We’ve defined seven (7) [focus areas of metrics](#metrics-focus-areas), and are working on further defining these areas. We’ve also established a roadmap of [2019 objectives](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/goals-2019.md) to guide our work.

We invite anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion to learn more, and join us. See [Contributing](#contributing) below to join the mailing list, or one of our weekly video calls.

## Background

### Problem Statement

The tech industry has a well-documented representation gap, and this issue is even more prevalent in open source communities. While there has been a marked emphasis on increasing diversity in these communities in recent years, numbers lag and the ability to foster inclusive environments remains challenging. With no standards or best practices for measuring inclusion, contributors, users and project teams lack the opportunity to make ethical, data-driven decisions.

### Opportunity

For the D&I Working Group, within the CHAOSS project.

CHAOSS mission from website:

> The CHAOSS community is developing metrics, methodologies, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability. By measuring open source project health and sustainability, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency of open source project health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.

Community health cannot exist without diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is thus central to the CHAOSS project goals. See [Objective 3](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/goals-2019.md) for more details on adding D&I to the CHAOSS mission.

### Goal

The CHAOSS D&I Working Group establishes and broadly communicates an ethical, peer-validated, research-informed, set of standards and best practices for measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects, and ensures that CHAOSS project software can implement D&I metrics according to identified goals for inclusion with validation from key industry partnerships in open source. See [2019 objectives](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/goals-2019.md) for more detail. 

### Work To Date

Between January and December 2018, the CHAOSS D&I Working Group has:

* established collaboration spaces, including a mailing list, GitHub repository, and weekly calls.
* defined 7 focus areas, which group metrics.
* established a template for resource pages that describe why D&I metrics are helpful and how to measure them.
* filled out an initial 10 resource pages.
* presented at 5 conferences via presentations, panels, and tutorials.
* established [2019 objectives](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/goals-2019.md).

## Objectives

We have established specific objectives for 2019. Explore them [here](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/goals-2019.md).

## Metrics Focus Areas

We are compiling [dimensions of diversity and inclusion](./demographic-data/) that can be used in the following areas of analysis:

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|1. [Event Diversity](./focus-areas/events/) | Identify the diversity and inclusion at events. |
|2. [Contributor Community Diversity](./focus-areas/contribution/) | Identify the diversity of the contributions within a community, and howe those different contributions are valued.|
|3. [Communication Inclusivity](./focus-areas/communication/) | Identify how we are communicating with contributors, and potential contributors.|
|4. [Recognition of Good Work](./focus-areas/recognition/) | Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.|
|5. [Leadership](./focus-areas/leadership/) | Identify how healthy our community leadership is.|
|6. [Governance](./focus-areas/governance/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our governance is.|
|7. [Project and Community](./focus-areas/project-and-community/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our project places, where community engagement occurs, are.|

Each area lists a collection of relevant questions. If you are interested in answering a question for your community, go to the associated resource page where we collect strategies for answering the question.

## Workflow

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.

## Contributing

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas of work such as **diversity and inclusion** from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, **Python** development,
**tech writing**, people interested in **speaking** at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but we’ve provided a few steps as good starting points:

- Introduce yourself on the [CHAOSS D&I WG mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss-diversity-inclusion), and tell us a little bit about your interests.
- Join us on our weekly video conferences. We meets every Monday at 11:00am CT (usually 18:00 CET, [check your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Chicago/2019-11-04/11:00/w/CHAOSS%20D%26I%20WG)) via [Zoom](https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288). Checkout our [agenda and meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzDk84BL7FfHDxbFxJz39M72V2Hfc5Y6oCPhOl6woxo/edit).
- Come see us at upcoming [conferences and workshops](https://chaoss.community/community/#user-content-upcoming-events).
- Review the Metrics Focus Areas and provide your feedback.
- Review the [issue list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues) and fix some of the issues.

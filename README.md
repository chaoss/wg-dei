# What is this working group about?

This working group aims at bringing experiences measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects.

Its main goal focuses on understanding from a qualitative and quantitative point of view how diversity and inclusion
can be measured. This will bring four main outcomes:
* First a set of metrics curated by the community focused on understanding and measuring diversity
* Second learn good practices from open source communities on improving their diversity and inclusion
* Third produce useful software to measure diversity from a quantitative point of view. This is expected to produce generic software to analyze several repositories of information such as Git repositories or Mailing lists
* Fourth, good practices on how to deal with such data, maintain and ways of collaboration with open source communities.

An example of the expected outcomes is the [OpenStack Gender Report](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/)
that focuses on the analysis of the gender-diversity in the OpenStack Foundation. This project sponsored by Intel and Bitergia
aims at helping the community with data. And we need data to make decisions!

This project is under the [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) project that is part of The Linux Foundation.

As the CHAOSS project consists of two Technical Committees: Software and Metrics, this project aims at
working closely with both and learn their best practices. In addition, this working group expects
to discuss new ideas in terms of metrics and software with both committees improving the knowledge
base around this topic.


## Roadmap

- Coordination meeting: February 13, 2018 at 12-noon (US Central Time)
- BoF at OSLS March 6-8, 2018
- Moving forward? Bi-weekly or monthly calls? Work in GitHub or another inclusive technology?

**Steps**
- Get everyone on board, form working group (finish by BoF at OSLS)
- Target date for first report? milestones to get there? (decide during BoF at OSLS)
- Iteratively work on metrics and software together to balance what we would like to include in the report and what we can include in the report.
- Formalize quantitative and qualitative data collection methods that communities can deploy.
- Release a first draft of the report and tools to generate it.


## Metrics Work

More to be done.

Metrics used in OpenStack Gender Report --- starting point for thinking about other diversity and inclusion metrics.

__Governance and Leadership__

 - Board of Directors
 - Technical Committee
 - User Committee
 - Working Groups Chairs
 - OpenStack Ambassadors
 - Project Technical Leaders
 - OpenStack Foundation Officers
 - Ratio of minority identification to whole community
 - Role in community (basis for calculating minority ratios within each committee/workgroup/organ)

__Summits Representation__

 - Keynote summits representation
 - Summit attendees
 - Summit speakers

__Technical Contributions__

 - Number of commits by minority over time
 - Number of developers by minority authoring those commits over time
 - Types of contributions (code and others) by minority within those commits over time
 - Number of code review submissions by  minority over time
 - Number of developers who have submitted changesets, by minority over time
 - Number of code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of developers who have voted in a code review process, by minority over time
 - Number of core code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of core code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of developers who have participated in a core code review process, by minority over time
 - Ratio_Authors: The number in this column denotes the ratio of minority developers for every 100 developers for a given project.
 - Ratio_Commits: The number in this column denotes the ratio of commits submitted by minority developers for every 100 commits submitted by all developers for a given project.
 - Authors: The number in this column denotes the total number of individuals identified as minority who have contributed to a given project, as tracked through the Git repositories.
 - Commits: The number in this column denotes the total number of changes to the source code for a given project. A commit is usually submitted through a code review process.

__Non Technical Contributions__

 - Number of emails by gender
 - Emails activity by gender
 - Characterization of mailing lists (development, users)


__Minority identities__

Standard survey questions for identity relating to diversity:
https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/tree/master/doc-source/questions

 - Age
 - Disability
 - Education
 - Gender
 - Language
 - Location
 - Race
 - Religion
 - Sexual and Romantic Orientation
 - Socioeconomic Class

## Software Work

To be done

## How can you help?

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas
of work such as diversity and inclusion from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, Python development,
tech writing, people interested in speaking at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but a first good step would be to introduce yourself at the
[CHAOSS Metrics](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/oss-health-metrics) or
[CHAOSS Software](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss-software) mailing lists explaining
a bit your interest.

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions
about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.


## Communication Channels


* Metrics and Software Discussions mailing list at [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/contact/)
* CHAOSS Community IRC Channels: #chaoss-community at freenode
* Face to face meetings during the Open Source Summits or in other events such as FOSDEM.

# What is this working group about?

This working group aims at bringing experiences measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects.

Its main goal focuses on understanding from a qualitative and quantitative point of view how diversity and inclusion
can be measured. This will bring four main outcomes:
* First a set of metrics curated by the community focused on understanding and measuring diversity
* Second learn good practices from open source communities on improving their diversity and inclusion
* Third produce useful software to measure diversity from a quantitative point of view. This is expected to produce generic software to analyze several repositories of information such as Git repositories or Mailing lists
* Fourth, good practices on how to deal with such data, maintain and ways of collaboration with open source communities.
* Fifth, a method that other communities can reproduce the report for themselves.

An example of the expected outcomes is the [OpenStack Gender Report](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/)
that focuses on the analysis of the gender-diversity in the OpenStack Foundation. This project sponsored by Intel and Bitergia
aims at helping the community with data. And we need data to make decisions!

This project is under the [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) project that is part of The Linux Foundation, with participation from multiple other organizations and institutions  (see contributors list).

As the CHAOSS project consists of two Technical Committees: Software and Metrics, this project aims at
working closely with both and learn their best practices. In addition, this working group expects
to discuss new ideas in terms of metrics and software with both committees improving the knowledge
base around this topic.

*Note:* We want to make our tools and report inclusive globally.

## Roadmap

* Integrate results with the general Metrics group
  * Write down all of the goal-question-metric ideas we have in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzDk84BL7FfHDxbFxJz39M72V2Hfc5Y6oCPhOl6woxo/edit#)
  * [#14](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/14) Migrate Google Docs D&I GQM approach to this repository
* Validate with experts in the field.
* Produce reusable outcomes by third parties when measuring D&I
  * [#15](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/issues/15) Create a method that other communities can reproduce the report for themselves
* Dissemination of the results across several communities
  * Open Source Summit NA / Europe
  * OSCON
  * CHAOSScon NA
  * Others

## Structure of Repository

We are compiling [dimensions of diversity and inclusion](./di_metrics.md) that can be used in the following areas of analysis:

1. [Event Diversity](./goal_events.md)
2. [Contributor Community Diversity](./goal_contribution.md)
3. [Communication Inclusivity](./goal_communication.md)
4. [Recognition of Good Work](./goal_recognition.md)
5. [Leadership](./goal_leadership.md)
6. [Governance](./goal_governance.md)
7. [Project Places](./goal_project_places.md)

Each area lists a collection of relevant questions. If you are interested in answering a question for your community, go to the associated resource page where we collect strategies for answering the question.

## Upcoming meetings

- We meet every other week. Next meeting: July 11th, 2018 at 6pm European Central Time (9am US Pacific Time). We will use the CHAOSS Zoom room: https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288

## Meeting Minutes

## Metrics Work

## Software Work

To be done

## How can you help?

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas of work such as **diversity and inclusion** from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, **Python** development,
**tech writing**, people interested in **speaking** at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but a first good step would be to introduce yourself at the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://chaoss.community/participate/#user-content-join-the-mailing-list) explaining a bit your interest.

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions
about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.
